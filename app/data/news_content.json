In case of gold prices in the international markets, there was a significant uptick during the week, rising approximately 3% to reach USD 3,303.92/Oz as of early Friday. This can be attributed to weakening dollar which saw depreciation of over 1% this week, followed by growing investor concerns regarding the fiscal outlook of the US. Domestically, gold price surpassed INR 96,000/10gms and remain range-bound between INR 93,000/10 gm to INR 96,000/10gms during the week. This was owing to the ripple effects of the international factors at play that fueled gold prices in the domestic market. Silver, on the other hand, saw 0.1% increase with prices hovering at USD 33.12/Oz in international market. Domestically, silver prices stood at INR 98,000/kg. This can be attributed to the cautious investor sentiments followed by global commodity trends and price movements. Moving forward to next week, the outlook for gold remains bullish with a possibility for a potential short-term correction. International Prices are expected to trade in the range of USD 3300-3400/Oz, supported by ongoing geopolitical tensions and uncertain outlook over US fiscal policies signaling economic instability in the biggest economy of the world. Domestic Prices can hover in the range of INR 95,000-96,000/10 gms. For silver, prices may remain relatively stable, unless any major economic development takes precedence.\u201d 15:50 | May 23, 2025 Stock market live today: Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance ties up with Equitas Bank to boost rural reach Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance ties up with Equitas Bank to boost rural reach ABSLI partners with Equitas Small Finance Bank to expand life insurance accessibility, targeting financial inclusion in underserved markets. 15:40 | May 23, 2025 Share market live updates: Sensex ended 769.09 pts or 0.95% higher at 81,721.08, and Nifty 50 closed 243.45 pts or 0.99% positive at 24,853.15.

Stock market live updates today: Morgan Stanley Strategists say buy America except the Dollar Morgan Stanley has raised its call on US stocks and Treasuries on expectations that a slew of future interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will support bonds and boost company earnings. The Wall Street bank has turned overweight on American stocks and sovereign bonds from a neutral stance, according to a note from strategists including Serena Tang, global head of cross-asset strategy research. The S&P 500 Index will reach 6,500 by the second quarter of 2026, while the yield on 10-year Treasuries will drop to 3.45%, they said. However, the dollar should continue to weaken thanks to a \u201cconvergence in US rates and growth to peers,\u201d the strategists wrote in the note dated May 20. Morgan Stanley\u2019s latest outlook comes as US markets recover from the losses brought on by President Donald Trump\u2019s global trade war in April. Investors now have to navigate the fading appeal of US exceptionalism, wait on tariffs negotiations and fractious budget talks on Capitol Hill, while weighing the potential for rate cuts. \u201cWe think that stocks won\u2019t revisit the lows of April in the near term, especially since the large drawdowns experienced year to date have mainly been reactions to tariff shock-and-awe,\u201d the strategists wrote. \u201cOur equity strategists see the future US policy agenda to be more accommodating, and expect the seven Fed cuts our economists anticipate for 2026 to be supportive of higher-than-average valuations.\u201d The S&P 500 has recouped losses brought on by Trump\u2019s Liberation Day after he clawed back most tariff increases while trade talks start. It closed at 5,940 on Tuesday. Yields on Treasuries though have continued to gain, with the 10-year trading at 4.51%, on concern that proposed tax cuts will widen the US budget deficit. \u201cDespite unprecedented policy uncertainty, the global economy is still in expansion mode, albeit with slowing growth,\u201d the strategists wrote in the note. \u201cSubstantial monetary easing is ahead along with the benefits of deregulation.\u201d 08:13 | May 23, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Economic Calendar \u2013 23.05.2025 11:30 U.K. Retail sales m/m (Expected: 0.4% versus Previous: 0.4%) 19:30 U.S. New Home

The BSE Sensex plunged 644.64 points, or 0.79%, to close at 80,951.99, after falling over 1,100 points intraday. The NSE Nifty dropped 203.75 points, or 0.82%, to settle at 24,609.70. Weak cues from global markets followed a spike in US Treasury yields and concerns that the proposed US budget could inflate national debt. A recent downgrade in the US credit outlook further spooked investors, causing widespread selling across Asian equities. Among major laggards were Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv, Tech Mahindra, and ITC, while IndusInd Bank, Bharti Airtel, and UltraTech Cement bucked the trend to post gains. On the NSE, out of 2,949 stocks traded, 1,275 advanced, 1,582 declined, and 92 remained unchanged. Meanwhile, 45 stocks touched 52-week highs, 17 hit 52-week lows, 84 stocks were locked in upper circuits, and 53 hit lower circuits. By KS Badri Narayanan Team BL Updated - May 22, 2025  at 07:28 PM.

Stock up 2.81% on the NSE to \u20b91,082 12:29 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Four sustainability sectors to see capital investment opportunity of US $600 bn by 2030 in India: Azalea Capital Azalea Capital, a boutique investment bank in Mumbai specialising in structured and distressed financing for businesses underserved by larger banks, stated in a webinar on the state of private financing in India that the country\u2019s sustainable infrastructure push will unlock US $600bn investment opportunities across critical sectors such as electric mobility, renewable energy, battery storage, recycling and agricultural infrastructure by 2030. Driven by government mandate and international climate goals, the demand for capital in these sectors is set to rise sharply. These investments are critical not only for meeting sustainability goals, but also for strengthening long-term energy and food security in India. Clean Mobility: Electrification of public and intercity transport- A capital investment opportunity of $200bn by 2030. Under the latest government mandate, all new buses procured under state and municipal schemes must be electric. With over 1.7 lakh buses set for replacement and an average cost of \u20b91 crore each, this translates into a \u20b91.7 lakh crore market opportunity in the public sector alone. A similar scale of opportunity exists in the private intercity bus segment, connecting metros like Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. Top OEMs including Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, and JBM Auto are expected to lead this shift. These players are also entering operations and maintenance, opening avenues for senior debt, equity capital, and structured financing. Green Energy transition: Industrial solar & battery storage: A capital investment opportunity of $200BN by 2030. Driven by global decarbonization targets\u2014especially in industries like steel and aluminium\u2014India Inc. is rapidly adopting dedicated solar plants and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). With export-dependent sectors preparing for EU\u2019s green steel mandates post-2030, clean energy integration is accelerating. To balance peak demand and grid stability, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are gaining momentum. Gujarat has already issued multi-thousand crore tenders, marking the beginning of a nationwide rollout. Circular Economy: Waste to value- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030. India\u2019s new extended producer responsibility (EPR) mandates are transforming the recycling industry. In the battery segment alone, 100% recovery compliance has made organized recycling not just viable but necessary. Lead-acid battery recycling is achieving over 97% efficiency, and similar circular systems are emerging for Plastics, lithium-ion batteries, tires, and e-waste under EPR scheme ( Extended Producers Responsibility). This shift is curbing hazardous informal processing and unlocking new revenue streams in regulated recycling ecosystems. Agriculture & Food Security: Modern silo infrastructure; Data centers & Green Tech Ecosystems- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030 The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is entering long-term \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d contracts with private players for high-tech grain silos, akin to the tank farms in oil and gas. These silos, strategically located across major agricultural belts, will store grains like rice, wheat, and pulses in scientifically designed, climate-resilient facilities, ensuring year-round food availability and minimizing wastage. India\u2019s growing digital economy is fuelling demand for green-powered data centers, which now serve as hubs integrating solar, wind, energy storage, and smart grid technologies. This emerging sector represents the convergence of digital and sustainable infrastructure, offering scalable and future-ready investment opportunities. 12:28 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live news: Himadri Speciality Chemical approves acquisition of 16.24% stake in International Battery Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on fully diluted basis.

This was made worse by Moody\u2019s recent reduction of the US credit rating because of growing debt levels and the Fed\u2019s cautious economic outlook. \u00b7 With the continuous turmoil in West Asia and President Trump\u2019s apparent retreat from mediating the Russia-Ukraine issue, geopolitical tensions further increased the allure of gold. \u00b7 In the meantime, Chinese customs statistics revealed that robust demand and the central bank\u2019s issuance of additional import quotas amid the height of US-China trade tensions caused gold imports to soar to an 11-month high of 127.5 metric tonnes in April, up 73% from March. Technical Triggers \u00b7 As gold has changed its momentum and moved higher above $3300 (~Rs 95500), the rally can continue towards $3380 (~Rs 97500), but prices are expected not to sustain beyond that. \u00b7 Silver prices are gaining momentum and close to their resistance level of $34(~Rs 99500). We could see a reversal if prices don\u2019t sustain. If prices sustain above these levels, the next target would be $35(~Rs 102,000). 11:54 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Highways Infrastructure Trust adds 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model highway projects from PNC Infratech Highways Infrastructure Trust (HIT), a SEBI-registered infrastructure investment trust, announces the addition of 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) highway projects from PNC Infratech Ltd to its portfolio.

We cut FY26-27 est. by 40% as we adjust for the inflated base profitability Rating downgrade due to path to 1% ROA now long drawn and business uncertainty The next event to monitor is the recommendation of new CEO by the Board to the RBI by 30th June ICICI Sec on IndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs650 Reports loss with weak core NIM/PPOP; growth/RoA revival yet uncertain Core profitability, adjusted for one-offs, was weak too with NIM at 3.47% (down 46bps QoQ) while PPOP slipped 24% YoY to INR 30.62bn. CET 1 and LCR levels are comfortable at 15.1% and 118%, respectively. The board is yet to recommend a name for its MD&CEO position to the RBI. We continue to believe that IIB would prioritise balance sheet stability vs. growth while the path to RoA revival remains uncertain, even if it was to get a signature hire. We believe, the bank would prioritise balance sheet liquidity/granularity; thus, it would likely report single-digit loan growth for FY26\u201327E. We estimate FY26 PPOP of ~INR 130bn, higher than annualised BAU Q4FY25 figures. We estimate ~1.6% credit costs for FY26/FY27, partly from its MFI portfolio (0\u201390dpd still elevated) and in a bid to shore-up contingent provisions (now nil). We estimate IIB to report <1% RoA and single-digit RoE for FY26/FY27 Investec on ndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs625 from Rs650 Cut earnings est by 40%/37% for FY26/27 Build in lower loan growth of 5%/10% for FY26/27 ROE outlook remains soft at 6%-7% IIB reported a PBT loss of Rs 30bn in 4Q, while also reporting a loss at the PPOP level of Rs 4.9bn. Bank highlighted negative P&L impact of Rs 49bn, relating to fraud committed by employees, much higher than Rs 26.5bn previously disclosed (for over-reported derivatives income and MFI interest) NII was down 43% YoY, which after adjusting for one-time hits was down 13% YoY (adjusted NIM at 3.5% down 45bp QoQ). This along with softer fees meant normalized PPOP (~Rs 27bn) was down 35% YoY and PPOP-level RoA is now at a soft 1.9% Slippages at Rs 50bn (5.9% vs 2.7% in 3Q) were elevated led by high MFI delinquencies (Rs 35bn of which Rs 19bn was driven by recognition of \u2018misclassified\u2019 loans). Bank\u2019s disclosures recognise fraud committed by \u2018certain employees having a significant role in accounting and financial reporting of the Bank\u2019. The P&L impact from these (recognised in 4Q) is shown in Fig 3. Bank highlighted that it is in the process of hiring a prospective CEO, for which it plans to submit names to RBI by 30 June 2025. We factor in softer PPOP UBS on IndusInd Sell, TP Rs 600 Q4 : Weak amidst uncertainty MFI loans had largest contribution to total -ve one-offs Board to recommend possible CEO names to RBI before 30th June Stk not inexpensive at current levels & uncertainty likely to result in derating MS on Indusind Downgrade to Underweight with Equal-weight; Cut TP to Rs 700 from Rs 755 Bear Case Playing Out Expected sharp NII miss post recent disclosures but were negatively surprised by incorrectly classified MFI slippages High margin loan mix is moving lower and will weigh on RoA recovery Expect gradual earnings recovery on a weak starting point Valuation at 0.9x FY26 book is not cheap in the context of 7-10% RoE that we expect over next two years Macquarie on Indusind Maintain Outperform with TP of Rs 1210 Q4: Large earnings miss, multiple events recognized Asset quality still a concern If one assumes that cleanup is largely done, which in itself is questionable, normalised PPOP was Rs 12000 cr annualised for Q4 Stock currently at 5x trailing PPOP, which is lower than peers Further, on a trailing book, the stock trades at 0.9x FY25 P/B Clarity around management succession, peak credit costs, sustainable NIMs, and governance are key monitorables CLSA on Indusind Maintain Hold; Cut TP to Rs 725 from Rs 780 A quarter to forget Core profitability muted; several one-offs lead to Rs22bn loss Core slippages in MFI elevated, but other segments stable FY26 to be a year of uncertainty Jefferies on Indusind Maintain Buy; Cut TP to Rs 920 from Rs 1040 Clean-up was larger than anticipated Exit run-rate of business is low; the new CEO is to lay a path forward Valuations are reasonable HSBC on Indusind Downgrade to Reduce from Buy; Hike TP to Rs 660 from Rs 770 IndusInd has effectively been pushed back to the pre-2009 era Right now, there is no clarity on the rebuilding process Cut FY26-27 EPS estimates by 41-43% as management has made one-off adjustments to correct accounting discrepancies MS on Interglobe Aviation OW, TP Raised to Rs 6502 4QF25 EBITDA of Rs59.5bn was 13% ahead of estimate.

The BSE Sensex plunged 644.64 points, or 0.79%, to close at 80,951.99, after falling over 1,100 points intraday. The NSE Nifty dropped 203.75 points, or 0.82%, to settle at 24,609.70. Weak cues from global markets followed a spike in US Treasury yields and concerns that the proposed US budget could inflate national debt. A recent downgrade in the US credit outlook further spooked investors, causing widespread selling across Asian equities. Among major laggards were Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv, Tech Mahindra, and ITC, while IndusInd Bank, Bharti Airtel, and UltraTech Cement bucked the trend to post gains. On the NSE, out of 2,949 stocks traded, 1,275 advanced, 1,582 declined, and 92 remained unchanged. Meanwhile, 45 stocks touched 52-week highs, 17 hit 52-week lows, 84 stocks were locked in upper circuits, and 53 hit lower circuits. By KS Badri Narayanan Team BL Updated - May 22, 2025  at 07:28 PM.

Stock up 2.81% on the NSE to \u20b91,082 12:29 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Four sustainability sectors to see capital investment opportunity of US $600 bn by 2030 in India: Azalea Capital Azalea Capital, a boutique investment bank in Mumbai specialising in structured and distressed financing for businesses underserved by larger banks, stated in a webinar on the state of private financing in India that the country\u2019s sustainable infrastructure push will unlock US $600bn investment opportunities across critical sectors such as electric mobility, renewable energy, battery storage, recycling and agricultural infrastructure by 2030. Driven by government mandate and international climate goals, the demand for capital in these sectors is set to rise sharply. These investments are critical not only for meeting sustainability goals, but also for strengthening long-term energy and food security in India. Clean Mobility: Electrification of public and intercity transport- A capital investment opportunity of $200bn by 2030. Under the latest government mandate, all new buses procured under state and municipal schemes must be electric. With over 1.7 lakh buses set for replacement and an average cost of \u20b91 crore each, this translates into a \u20b91.7 lakh crore market opportunity in the public sector alone. A similar scale of opportunity exists in the private intercity bus segment, connecting metros like Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. Top OEMs including Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, and JBM Auto are expected to lead this shift. These players are also entering operations and maintenance, opening avenues for senior debt, equity capital, and structured financing. Green Energy transition: Industrial solar & battery storage: A capital investment opportunity of $200BN by 2030. Driven by global decarbonization targets\u2014especially in industries like steel and aluminium\u2014India Inc. is rapidly adopting dedicated solar plants and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). With export-dependent sectors preparing for EU\u2019s green steel mandates post-2030, clean energy integration is accelerating. To balance peak demand and grid stability, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are gaining momentum. Gujarat has already issued multi-thousand crore tenders, marking the beginning of a nationwide rollout. Circular Economy: Waste to value- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030. India\u2019s new extended producer responsibility (EPR) mandates are transforming the recycling industry. In the battery segment alone, 100% recovery compliance has made organized recycling not just viable but necessary. Lead-acid battery recycling is achieving over 97% efficiency, and similar circular systems are emerging for Plastics, lithium-ion batteries, tires, and e-waste under EPR scheme ( Extended Producers Responsibility). This shift is curbing hazardous informal processing and unlocking new revenue streams in regulated recycling ecosystems. Agriculture & Food Security: Modern silo infrastructure; Data centers & Green Tech Ecosystems- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030 The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is entering long-term \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d contracts with private players for high-tech grain silos, akin to the tank farms in oil and gas. These silos, strategically located across major agricultural belts, will store grains like rice, wheat, and pulses in scientifically designed, climate-resilient facilities, ensuring year-round food availability and minimizing wastage. India\u2019s growing digital economy is fuelling demand for green-powered data centers, which now serve as hubs integrating solar, wind, energy storage, and smart grid technologies. This emerging sector represents the convergence of digital and sustainable infrastructure, offering scalable and future-ready investment opportunities. 12:28 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live news: Himadri Speciality Chemical approves acquisition of 16.24% stake in International Battery Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on fully diluted basis.

This was made worse by Moody\u2019s recent reduction of the US credit rating because of growing debt levels and the Fed\u2019s cautious economic outlook. \u00b7 With the continuous turmoil in West Asia and President Trump\u2019s apparent retreat from mediating the Russia-Ukraine issue, geopolitical tensions further increased the allure of gold. \u00b7 In the meantime, Chinese customs statistics revealed that robust demand and the central bank\u2019s issuance of additional import quotas amid the height of US-China trade tensions caused gold imports to soar to an 11-month high of 127.5 metric tonnes in April, up 73% from March. Technical Triggers \u00b7 As gold has changed its momentum and moved higher above $3300 (~Rs 95500), the rally can continue towards $3380 (~Rs 97500), but prices are expected not to sustain beyond that. \u00b7 Silver prices are gaining momentum and close to their resistance level of $34(~Rs 99500). We could see a reversal if prices don\u2019t sustain. If prices sustain above these levels, the next target would be $35(~Rs 102,000). 11:54 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Highways Infrastructure Trust adds 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model highway projects from PNC Infratech Highways Infrastructure Trust (HIT), a SEBI-registered infrastructure investment trust, announces the addition of 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) highway projects from PNC Infratech Ltd to its portfolio.

We cut FY26-27 est. by 40% as we adjust for the inflated base profitability Rating downgrade due to path to 1% ROA now long drawn and business uncertainty The next event to monitor is the recommendation of new CEO by the Board to the RBI by 30th June ICICI Sec on IndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs650 Reports loss with weak core NIM/PPOP; growth/RoA revival yet uncertain Core profitability, adjusted for one-offs, was weak too with NIM at 3.47% (down 46bps QoQ) while PPOP slipped 24% YoY to INR 30.62bn. CET 1 and LCR levels are comfortable at 15.1% and 118%, respectively. The board is yet to recommend a name for its MD&CEO position to the RBI. We continue to believe that IIB would prioritise balance sheet stability vs. growth while the path to RoA revival remains uncertain, even if it was to get a signature hire. We believe, the bank would prioritise balance sheet liquidity/granularity; thus, it would likely report single-digit loan growth for FY26\u201327E. We estimate FY26 PPOP of ~INR 130bn, higher than annualised BAU Q4FY25 figures. We estimate ~1.6% credit costs for FY26/FY27, partly from its MFI portfolio (0\u201390dpd still elevated) and in a bid to shore-up contingent provisions (now nil). We estimate IIB to report <1% RoA and single-digit RoE for FY26/FY27 Investec on ndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs625 from Rs650 Cut earnings est by 40%/37% for FY26/27 Build in lower loan growth of 5%/10% for FY26/27 ROE outlook remains soft at 6%-7% IIB reported a PBT loss of Rs 30bn in 4Q, while also reporting a loss at the PPOP level of Rs 4.9bn. Bank highlighted negative P&L impact of Rs 49bn, relating to fraud committed by employees, much higher than Rs 26.5bn previously disclosed (for over-reported derivatives income and MFI interest) NII was down 43% YoY, which after adjusting for one-time hits was down 13% YoY (adjusted NIM at 3.5% down 45bp QoQ). This along with softer fees meant normalized PPOP (~Rs 27bn) was down 35% YoY and PPOP-level RoA is now at a soft 1.9% Slippages at Rs 50bn (5.9% vs 2.7% in 3Q) were elevated led by high MFI delinquencies (Rs 35bn of which Rs 19bn was driven by recognition of \u2018misclassified\u2019 loans). Bank\u2019s disclosures recognise fraud committed by \u2018certain employees having a significant role in accounting and financial reporting of the Bank\u2019. The P&L impact from these (recognised in 4Q) is shown in Fig 3. Bank highlighted that it is in the process of hiring a prospective CEO, for which it plans to submit names to RBI by 30 June 2025. We factor in softer PPOP UBS on IndusInd Sell, TP Rs 600 Q4 : Weak amidst uncertainty MFI loans had largest contribution to total -ve one-offs Board to recommend possible CEO names to RBI before 30th June Stk not inexpensive at current levels & uncertainty likely to result in derating MS on Indusind Downgrade to Underweight with Equal-weight; Cut TP to Rs 700 from Rs 755 Bear Case Playing Out Expected sharp NII miss post recent disclosures but were negatively surprised by incorrectly classified MFI slippages High margin loan mix is moving lower and will weigh on RoA recovery Expect gradual earnings recovery on a weak starting point Valuation at 0.9x FY26 book is not cheap in the context of 7-10% RoE that we expect over next two years Macquarie on Indusind Maintain Outperform with TP of Rs 1210 Q4: Large earnings miss, multiple events recognized Asset quality still a concern If one assumes that cleanup is largely done, which in itself is questionable, normalised PPOP was Rs 12000 cr annualised for Q4 Stock currently at 5x trailing PPOP, which is lower than peers Further, on a trailing book, the stock trades at 0.9x FY25 P/B Clarity around management succession, peak credit costs, sustainable NIMs, and governance are key monitorables CLSA on Indusind Maintain Hold; Cut TP to Rs 725 from Rs 780 A quarter to forget Core profitability muted; several one-offs lead to Rs22bn loss Core slippages in MFI elevated, but other segments stable FY26 to be a year of uncertainty Jefferies on Indusind Maintain Buy; Cut TP to Rs 920 from Rs 1040 Clean-up was larger than anticipated Exit run-rate of business is low; the new CEO is to lay a path forward Valuations are reasonable HSBC on Indusind Downgrade to Reduce from Buy; Hike TP to Rs 660 from Rs 770 IndusInd has effectively been pushed back to the pre-2009 era Right now, there is no clarity on the rebuilding process Cut FY26-27 EPS estimates by 41-43% as management has made one-off adjustments to correct accounting discrepancies MS on Interglobe Aviation OW, TP Raised to Rs 6502 4QF25 EBITDA of Rs59.5bn was 13% ahead of estimate.

The BSE Sensex plunged 644.64 points, or 0.79%, to close at 80,951.99, after falling over 1,100 points intraday. The NSE Nifty dropped 203.75 points, or 0.82%, to settle at 24,609.70. Weak cues from global markets followed a spike in US Treasury yields and concerns that the proposed US budget could inflate national debt. A recent downgrade in the US credit outlook further spooked investors, causing widespread selling across Asian equities. Among major laggards were Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv, Tech Mahindra, and ITC, while IndusInd Bank, Bharti Airtel, and UltraTech Cement bucked the trend to post gains. On the NSE, out of 2,949 stocks traded, 1,275 advanced, 1,582 declined, and 92 remained unchanged.

Driven by government mandate and international climate goals, the demand for capital in these sectors is set to rise sharply. These investments are critical not only for meeting sustainability goals, but also for strengthening long-term energy and food security in India. Clean Mobility: Electrification of public and intercity transport- A capital investment opportunity of $200bn by 2030. Under the latest government mandate, all new buses procured under state and municipal schemes must be electric. With over 1.7 lakh buses set for replacement and an average cost of \u20b91 crore each, this translates into a \u20b91.7 lakh crore market opportunity in the public sector alone. A similar scale of opportunity exists in the private intercity bus segment, connecting metros like Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. Top OEMs including Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, and JBM Auto are expected to lead this shift. These players are also entering operations and maintenance, opening avenues for senior debt, equity capital, and structured financing. Green Energy transition: Industrial solar & battery storage: A capital investment opportunity of $200BN by 2030. Driven by global decarbonization targets\u2014especially in industries like steel and aluminium\u2014India Inc. is rapidly adopting dedicated solar plants and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). With export-dependent sectors preparing for EU\u2019s green steel mandates post-2030, clean energy integration is accelerating. To balance peak demand and grid stability, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are gaining momentum. Gujarat has already issued multi-thousand crore tenders, marking the beginning of a nationwide rollout. Circular Economy: Waste to value- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030. India\u2019s new extended producer responsibility (EPR) mandates are transforming the recycling industry. In the battery segment alone, 100% recovery compliance has made organized recycling not just viable but necessary. Lead-acid battery recycling is achieving over 97% efficiency, and similar circular systems are emerging for Plastics, lithium-ion batteries, tires, and e-waste under EPR scheme ( Extended Producers Responsibility). This shift is curbing hazardous informal processing and unlocking new revenue streams in regulated recycling ecosystems. Agriculture & Food Security: Modern silo infrastructure; Data centers & Green Tech Ecosystems- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030 The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is entering long-term \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d contracts with private players for high-tech grain silos, akin to the tank farms in oil and gas. These silos, strategically located across major agricultural belts, will store grains like rice, wheat, and pulses in scientifically designed, climate-resilient facilities, ensuring year-round food availability and minimizing wastage. India\u2019s growing digital economy is fuelling demand for green-powered data centers, which now serve as hubs integrating solar, wind, energy storage, and smart grid technologies. This emerging sector represents the convergence of digital and sustainable infrastructure, offering scalable and future-ready investment opportunities. 12:28 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live news: Himadri Speciality Chemical approves acquisition of 16.24% stake in International Battery Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on fully diluted basis.

This was made worse by Moody\u2019s recent reduction of the US credit rating because of growing debt levels and the Fed\u2019s cautious economic outlook. \u00b7 With the continuous turmoil in West Asia and President Trump\u2019s apparent retreat from mediating the Russia-Ukraine issue, geopolitical tensions further increased the allure of gold. \u00b7 In the meantime, Chinese customs statistics revealed that robust demand and the central bank\u2019s issuance of additional import quotas amid the height of US-China trade tensions caused gold imports to soar to an 11-month high of 127.5 metric tonnes in April, up 73% from March. Technical Triggers \u00b7 As gold has changed its momentum and moved higher above $3300 (~Rs 95500), the rally can continue towards $3380 (~Rs 97500), but prices are expected not to sustain beyond that. \u00b7 Silver prices are gaining momentum and close to their resistance level of $34(~Rs 99500). We could see a reversal if prices don\u2019t sustain. If prices sustain above these levels, the next target would be $35(~Rs 102,000). 11:54 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Highways Infrastructure Trust adds 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model highway projects from PNC Infratech Highways Infrastructure Trust (HIT), a SEBI-registered infrastructure investment trust, announces the addition of 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) highway projects from PNC Infratech Ltd to its portfolio.

We cut FY26-27 est. by 40% as we adjust for the inflated base profitability Rating downgrade due to path to 1% ROA now long drawn and business uncertainty The next event to monitor is the recommendation of new CEO by the Board to the RBI by 30th June ICICI Sec on IndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs650 Reports loss with weak core NIM/PPOP; growth/RoA revival yet uncertain Core profitability, adjusted for one-offs, was weak too with NIM at 3.47% (down 46bps QoQ) while PPOP slipped 24% YoY to INR 30.62bn. CET 1 and LCR levels are comfortable at 15.1% and 118%, respectively. The board is yet to recommend a name for its MD&CEO position to the RBI. We continue to believe that IIB would prioritise balance sheet stability vs. growth while the path to RoA revival remains uncertain, even if it was to get a signature hire. We believe, the bank would prioritise balance sheet liquidity/granularity; thus, it would likely report single-digit loan growth for FY26\u201327E. We estimate FY26 PPOP of ~INR 130bn, higher than annualised BAU Q4FY25 figures. We estimate ~1.6% credit costs for FY26/FY27, partly from its MFI portfolio (0\u201390dpd still elevated) and in a bid to shore-up contingent provisions (now nil). We estimate IIB to report <1% RoA and single-digit RoE for FY26/FY27 Investec on ndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs625 from Rs650 Cut earnings est by 40%/37% for FY26/27 Build in lower loan growth of 5%/10% for FY26/27 ROE outlook remains soft at 6%-7% IIB reported a PBT loss of Rs 30bn in 4Q, while also reporting a loss at the PPOP level of Rs 4.9bn. Bank highlighted negative P&L impact of Rs 49bn, relating to fraud committed by employees, much higher than Rs 26.5bn previously disclosed (for over-reported derivatives income and MFI interest) NII was down 43% YoY, which after adjusting for one-time hits was down 13% YoY (adjusted NIM at 3.5% down 45bp QoQ). This along with softer fees meant normalized PPOP (~Rs 27bn) was down 35% YoY and PPOP-level RoA is now at a soft 1.9% Slippages at Rs 50bn (5.9% vs 2.7% in 3Q) were elevated led by high MFI delinquencies (Rs 35bn of which Rs 19bn was driven by recognition of \u2018misclassified\u2019 loans). Bank\u2019s disclosures recognise fraud committed by \u2018certain employees having a significant role in accounting and financial reporting of the Bank\u2019. The P&L impact from these (recognised in 4Q) is shown in Fig 3. Bank highlighted that it is in the process of hiring a prospective CEO, for which it plans to submit names to RBI by 30 June 2025. We factor in softer PPOP UBS on IndusInd Sell, TP Rs 600 Q4 : Weak amidst uncertainty MFI loans had largest contribution to total -ve one-offs Board to recommend possible CEO names to RBI before 30th June Stk not inexpensive at current levels & uncertainty likely to result in derating MS on Indusind Downgrade to Underweight with Equal-weight; Cut TP to Rs 700 from Rs 755 Bear Case Playing Out Expected sharp NII miss post recent disclosures but were negatively surprised by incorrectly classified MFI slippages High margin loan mix is moving lower and will weigh on RoA recovery Expect gradual earnings recovery on a weak starting point Valuation at 0.9x FY26 book is not cheap in the context of 7-10% RoE that we expect over next two years Macquarie on Indusind Maintain Outperform with TP of Rs 1210 Q4: Large earnings miss, multiple events recognized Asset quality still a concern If one assumes that cleanup is largely done, which in itself is questionable, normalised PPOP was Rs 12000 cr annualised for Q4 Stock currently at 5x trailing PPOP, which is lower than peers Further, on a trailing book, the stock trades at 0.9x FY25 P/B Clarity around management succession, peak credit costs, sustainable NIMs, and governance are key monitorables CLSA on Indusind Maintain Hold; Cut TP to Rs 725 from Rs 780 A quarter to forget Core profitability muted; several one-offs lead to Rs22bn loss Core slippages in MFI elevated, but other segments stable FY26 to be a year of uncertainty Jefferies on Indusind Maintain Buy; Cut TP to Rs 920 from Rs 1040 Clean-up was larger than anticipated Exit run-rate of business is low; the new CEO is to lay a path forward Valuations are reasonable HSBC on Indusind Downgrade to Reduce from Buy; Hike TP to Rs 660 from Rs 770 IndusInd has effectively been pushed back to the pre-2009 era Right now, there is no clarity on the rebuilding process Cut FY26-27 EPS estimates by 41-43% as management has made one-off adjustments to correct accounting discrepancies MS on Interglobe Aviation OW, TP Raised to Rs 6502 4QF25 EBITDA of Rs59.5bn was 13% ahead of estimate.

Stock up 2.81% on the NSE to \u20b91,082 12:29 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Four sustainability sectors to see capital investment opportunity of US $600 bn by 2030 in India: Azalea Capital Azalea Capital, a boutique investment bank in Mumbai specialising in structured and distressed financing for businesses underserved by larger banks, stated in a webinar on the state of private financing in India that the country\u2019s sustainable infrastructure push will unlock US $600bn investment opportunities across critical sectors such as electric mobility, renewable energy, battery storage, recycling and agricultural infrastructure by 2030. Driven by government mandate and international climate goals, the demand for capital in these sectors is set to rise sharply. These investments are critical not only for meeting sustainability goals, but also for strengthening long-term energy and food security in India. Clean Mobility: Electrification of public and intercity transport- A capital investment opportunity of $200bn by 2030. Under the latest government mandate, all new buses procured under state and municipal schemes must be electric. With over 1.7 lakh buses set for replacement and an average cost of \u20b91 crore each, this translates into a \u20b91.7 lakh crore market opportunity in the public sector alone. A similar scale of opportunity exists in the private intercity bus segment, connecting metros like Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. Top OEMs including Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, and JBM Auto are expected to lead this shift. These players are also entering operations and maintenance, opening avenues for senior debt, equity capital, and structured financing. Green Energy transition: Industrial solar & battery storage: A capital investment opportunity of $200BN by 2030. Driven by global decarbonization targets\u2014especially in industries like steel and aluminium\u2014India Inc. is rapidly adopting dedicated solar plants and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). With export-dependent sectors preparing for EU\u2019s green steel mandates post-2030, clean energy integration is accelerating. To balance peak demand and grid stability, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are gaining momentum. Gujarat has already issued multi-thousand crore tenders, marking the beginning of a nationwide rollout. Circular Economy: Waste to value- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030. India\u2019s new extended producer responsibility (EPR) mandates are transforming the recycling industry. In the battery segment alone, 100% recovery compliance has made organized recycling not just viable but necessary. Lead-acid battery recycling is achieving over 97% efficiency, and similar circular systems are emerging for Plastics, lithium-ion batteries, tires, and e-waste under EPR scheme ( Extended Producers Responsibility). This shift is curbing hazardous informal processing and unlocking new revenue streams in regulated recycling ecosystems. Agriculture & Food Security: Modern silo infrastructure; Data centers & Green Tech Ecosystems- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030 The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is entering long-term \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d contracts with private players for high-tech grain silos, akin to the tank farms in oil and gas. These silos, strategically located across major agricultural belts, will store grains like rice, wheat, and pulses in scientifically designed, climate-resilient facilities, ensuring year-round food availability and minimizing wastage. India\u2019s growing digital economy is fuelling demand for green-powered data centers, which now serve as hubs integrating solar, wind, energy storage, and smart grid technologies. This emerging sector represents the convergence of digital and sustainable infrastructure, offering scalable and future-ready investment opportunities. 12:28 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live news: Himadri Speciality Chemical approves acquisition of 16.24% stake in International Battery Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on fully diluted basis.

This was made worse by Moody\u2019s recent reduction of the US credit rating because of growing debt levels and the Fed\u2019s cautious economic outlook. \u00b7 With the continuous turmoil in West Asia and President Trump\u2019s apparent retreat from mediating the Russia-Ukraine issue, geopolitical tensions further increased the allure of gold. \u00b7 In the meantime, Chinese customs statistics revealed that robust demand and the central bank\u2019s issuance of additional import quotas amid the height of US-China trade tensions caused gold imports to soar to an 11-month high of 127.5 metric tonnes in April, up 73% from March. Technical Triggers \u00b7 As gold has changed its momentum and moved higher above $3300 (~Rs 95500), the rally can continue towards $3380 (~Rs 97500), but prices are expected not to sustain beyond that. \u00b7 Silver prices are gaining momentum and close to their resistance level of $34(~Rs 99500). We could see a reversal if prices don\u2019t sustain. If prices sustain above these levels, the next target would be $35(~Rs 102,000). 11:54 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Highways Infrastructure Trust adds 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model highway projects from PNC Infratech Highways Infrastructure Trust (HIT), a SEBI-registered infrastructure investment trust, announces the addition of 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) highway projects from PNC Infratech Ltd to its portfolio.

We cut FY26-27 est. by 40% as we adjust for the inflated base profitability Rating downgrade due to path to 1% ROA now long drawn and business uncertainty The next event to monitor is the recommendation of new CEO by the Board to the RBI by 30th June ICICI Sec on IndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs650 Reports loss with weak core NIM/PPOP; growth/RoA revival yet uncertain Core profitability, adjusted for one-offs, was weak too with NIM at 3.47% (down 46bps QoQ) while PPOP slipped 24% YoY to INR 30.62bn. CET 1 and LCR levels are comfortable at 15.1% and 118%, respectively. The board is yet to recommend a name for its MD&CEO position to the RBI. We continue to believe that IIB would prioritise balance sheet stability vs. growth while the path to RoA revival remains uncertain, even if it was to get a signature hire. We believe, the bank would prioritise balance sheet liquidity/granularity; thus, it would likely report single-digit loan growth for FY26\u201327E. We estimate FY26 PPOP of ~INR 130bn, higher than annualised BAU Q4FY25 figures. We estimate ~1.6% credit costs for FY26/FY27, partly from its MFI portfolio (0\u201390dpd still elevated) and in a bid to shore-up contingent provisions (now nil). We estimate IIB to report <1% RoA and single-digit RoE for FY26/FY27 Investec on ndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs625 from Rs650 Cut earnings est by 40%/37% for FY26/27 Build in lower loan growth of 5%/10% for FY26/27 ROE outlook remains soft at 6%-7% IIB reported a PBT loss of Rs 30bn in 4Q, while also reporting a loss at the PPOP level of Rs 4.9bn. Bank highlighted negative P&L impact of Rs 49bn, relating to fraud committed by employees, much higher than Rs 26.5bn previously disclosed (for over-reported derivatives income and MFI interest) NII was down 43% YoY, which after adjusting for one-time hits was down 13% YoY (adjusted NIM at 3.5% down 45bp QoQ). This along with softer fees meant normalized PPOP (~Rs 27bn) was down 35% YoY and PPOP-level RoA is now at a soft 1.9% Slippages at Rs 50bn (5.9% vs 2.7% in 3Q) were elevated led by high MFI delinquencies (Rs 35bn of which Rs 19bn was driven by recognition of \u2018misclassified\u2019 loans). Bank\u2019s disclosures recognise fraud committed by \u2018certain employees having a significant role in accounting and financial reporting of the Bank\u2019. The P&L impact from these (recognised in 4Q) is shown in Fig 3. Bank highlighted that it is in the process of hiring a prospective CEO, for which it plans to submit names to RBI by 30 June 2025.

The BSE Sensex plunged 644.64 points, or 0.79%, to close at 80,951.99, after falling over 1,100 points intraday. The NSE Nifty dropped 203.75 points, or 0.82%, to settle at 24,609.70. Weak cues from global markets followed a spike in US Treasury yields and concerns that the proposed US budget could inflate national debt. A recent downgrade in the US credit outlook further spooked investors, causing widespread selling across Asian equities. Among major laggards were Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv, Tech Mahindra, and ITC, while IndusInd Bank, Bharti Airtel, and UltraTech Cement bucked the trend to post gains. On the NSE, out of 2,949 stocks traded, 1,275 advanced, 1,582 declined, and 92 remained unchanged.

Driven by government mandate and international climate goals, the demand for capital in these sectors is set to rise sharply. These investments are critical not only for meeting sustainability goals, but also for strengthening long-term energy and food security in India. Clean Mobility: Electrification of public and intercity transport- A capital investment opportunity of $200bn by 2030. Under the latest government mandate, all new buses procured under state and municipal schemes must be electric. With over 1.7 lakh buses set for replacement and an average cost of \u20b91 crore each, this translates into a \u20b91.7 lakh crore market opportunity in the public sector alone. A similar scale of opportunity exists in the private intercity bus segment, connecting metros like Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. Top OEMs including Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, and JBM Auto are expected to lead this shift. These players are also entering operations and maintenance, opening avenues for senior debt, equity capital, and structured financing. Green Energy transition: Industrial solar & battery storage: A capital investment opportunity of $200BN by 2030. Driven by global decarbonization targets\u2014especially in industries like steel and aluminium\u2014India Inc. is rapidly adopting dedicated solar plants and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). With export-dependent sectors preparing for EU\u2019s green steel mandates post-2030, clean energy integration is accelerating. To balance peak demand and grid stability, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are gaining momentum. Gujarat has already issued multi-thousand crore tenders, marking the beginning of a nationwide rollout. Circular Economy: Waste to value- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030. India\u2019s new extended producer responsibility (EPR) mandates are transforming the recycling industry. In the battery segment alone, 100% recovery compliance has made organized recycling not just viable but necessary. Lead-acid battery recycling is achieving over 97% efficiency, and similar circular systems are emerging for Plastics, lithium-ion batteries, tires, and e-waste under EPR scheme ( Extended Producers Responsibility). This shift is curbing hazardous informal processing and unlocking new revenue streams in regulated recycling ecosystems. Agriculture & Food Security: Modern silo infrastructure; Data centers & Green Tech Ecosystems- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030 The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is entering long-term \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d contracts with private players for high-tech grain silos, akin to the tank farms in oil and gas. These silos, strategically located across major agricultural belts, will store grains like rice, wheat, and pulses in scientifically designed, climate-resilient facilities, ensuring year-round food availability and minimizing wastage. India\u2019s growing digital economy is fuelling demand for green-powered data centers, which now serve as hubs integrating solar, wind, energy storage, and smart grid technologies. This emerging sector represents the convergence of digital and sustainable infrastructure, offering scalable and future-ready investment opportunities. 12:28 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live news: Himadri Speciality Chemical approves acquisition of 16.24% stake in International Battery Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on fully diluted basis.

This was made worse by Moody\u2019s recent reduction of the US credit rating because of growing debt levels and the Fed\u2019s cautious economic outlook. \u00b7 With the continuous turmoil in West Asia and President Trump\u2019s apparent retreat from mediating the Russia-Ukraine issue, geopolitical tensions further increased the allure of gold. \u00b7 In the meantime, Chinese customs statistics revealed that robust demand and the central bank\u2019s issuance of additional import quotas amid the height of US-China trade tensions caused gold imports to soar to an 11-month high of 127.5 metric tonnes in April, up 73% from March. Technical Triggers \u00b7 As gold has changed its momentum and moved higher above $3300 (~Rs 95500), the rally can continue towards $3380 (~Rs 97500), but prices are expected not to sustain beyond that. \u00b7 Silver prices are gaining momentum and close to their resistance level of $34(~Rs 99500). We could see a reversal if prices don\u2019t sustain. If prices sustain above these levels, the next target would be $35(~Rs 102,000). 11:54 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Highways Infrastructure Trust adds 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model highway projects from PNC Infratech Highways Infrastructure Trust (HIT), a SEBI-registered infrastructure investment trust, announces the addition of 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) highway projects from PNC Infratech Ltd to its portfolio.

We cut FY26-27 est. by 40% as we adjust for the inflated base profitability Rating downgrade due to path to 1% ROA now long drawn and business uncertainty The next event to monitor is the recommendation of new CEO by the Board to the RBI by 30th June ICICI Sec on IndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs650 Reports loss with weak core NIM/PPOP; growth/RoA revival yet uncertain Core profitability, adjusted for one-offs, was weak too with NIM at 3.47% (down 46bps QoQ) while PPOP slipped 24% YoY to INR 30.62bn. CET 1 and LCR levels are comfortable at 15.1% and 118%, respectively. The board is yet to recommend a name for its MD&CEO position to the RBI. We continue to believe that IIB would prioritise balance sheet stability vs. growth while the path to RoA revival remains uncertain, even if it was to get a signature hire. We believe, the bank would prioritise balance sheet liquidity/granularity; thus, it would likely report single-digit loan growth for FY26\u201327E. We estimate FY26 PPOP of ~INR 130bn, higher than annualised BAU Q4FY25 figures. We estimate ~1.6% credit costs for FY26/FY27, partly from its MFI portfolio (0\u201390dpd still elevated) and in a bid to shore-up contingent provisions (now nil). We estimate IIB to report <1% RoA and single-digit RoE for FY26/FY27 Investec on ndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs625 from Rs650 Cut earnings est by 40%/37% for FY26/27 Build in lower loan growth of 5%/10% for FY26/27 ROE outlook remains soft at 6%-7% IIB reported a PBT loss of Rs 30bn in 4Q, while also reporting a loss at the PPOP level of Rs 4.9bn. Bank highlighted negative P&L impact of Rs 49bn, relating to fraud committed by employees, much higher than Rs 26.5bn previously disclosed (for over-reported derivatives income and MFI interest) NII was down 43% YoY, which after adjusting for one-time hits was down 13% YoY (adjusted NIM at 3.5% down 45bp QoQ). This along with softer fees meant normalized PPOP (~Rs 27bn) was down 35% YoY and PPOP-level RoA is now at a soft 1.9% Slippages at Rs 50bn (5.9% vs 2.7% in 3Q) were elevated led by high MFI delinquencies (Rs 35bn of which Rs 19bn was driven by recognition of \u2018misclassified\u2019 loans). Bank\u2019s disclosures recognise fraud committed by \u2018certain employees having a significant role in accounting and financial reporting of the Bank\u2019. The P&L impact from these (recognised in 4Q) is shown in Fig 3. Bank highlighted that it is in the process of hiring a prospective CEO, for which it plans to submit names to RBI by 30 June 2025. We factor in softer PPOP UBS on IndusInd Sell, TP Rs 600 Q4 : Weak amidst uncertainty MFI loans had largest contribution to total -ve one-offs Board to recommend possible CEO names to RBI before 30th June Stk not inexpensive at current levels & uncertainty likely to result in derating MS on Indusind Downgrade to Underweight with Equal-weight; Cut TP to Rs 700 from Rs 755 Bear Case Playing Out Expected sharp NII miss post recent disclosures but were negatively surprised by incorrectly classified MFI slippages High margin loan mix is moving lower and will weigh on RoA recovery Expect gradual earnings recovery on a weak starting point Valuation at 0.9x FY26 book is not cheap in the context of 7-10% RoE that we expect over next two years Macquarie on Indusind Maintain Outperform with TP of Rs 1210 Q4: Large earnings miss, multiple events recognized Asset quality still a concern If one assumes that cleanup is largely done, which in itself is questionable, normalised PPOP was Rs 12000 cr annualised for Q4 Stock currently at 5x trailing PPOP, which is lower than peers Further, on a trailing book, the stock trades at 0.9x FY25 P/B Clarity around management succession, peak credit costs, sustainable NIMs, and governance are key monitorables CLSA on Indusind Maintain Hold; Cut TP to Rs 725 from Rs 780 A quarter to forget Core profitability muted; several one-offs lead to Rs22bn loss Core slippages in MFI elevated, but other segments stable FY26 to be a year of uncertainty Jefferies on Indusind Maintain Buy; Cut TP to Rs 920 from Rs 1040 Clean-up was larger than anticipated Exit run-rate of business is low; the new CEO is to lay a path forward Valuations are reasonable HSBC on Indusind Downgrade to Reduce from Buy; Hike TP to Rs 660 from Rs 770 IndusInd has effectively been pushed back to the pre-2009 era Right now, there is no clarity on the rebuilding process Cut FY26-27 EPS estimates by 41-43% as management has made one-off adjustments to correct accounting discrepancies MS on Interglobe Aviation OW, TP Raised to Rs 6502 4QF25 EBITDA of Rs59.5bn was 13% ahead of estimate.

The BSE Sensex plunged 644.64 points, or 0.79%, to close at 80,951.99, after falling over 1,100 points intraday. The NSE Nifty dropped 203.75 points, or 0.82%, to settle at 24,609.70. Weak cues from global markets followed a spike in US Treasury yields and concerns that the proposed US budget could inflate national debt. A recent downgrade in the US credit outlook further spooked investors, causing widespread selling across Asian equities. Among major laggards were Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv, Tech Mahindra, and ITC, while IndusInd Bank, Bharti Airtel, and UltraTech Cement bucked the trend to post gains.

Stock up 2.81% on the NSE to \u20b91,082 12:29 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Four sustainability sectors to see capital investment opportunity of US $600 bn by 2030 in India: Azalea Capital Azalea Capital, a boutique investment bank in Mumbai specialising in structured and distressed financing for businesses underserved by larger banks, stated in a webinar on the state of private financing in India that the country\u2019s sustainable infrastructure push will unlock US $600bn investment opportunities across critical sectors such as electric mobility, renewable energy, battery storage, recycling and agricultural infrastructure by 2030. Driven by government mandate and international climate goals, the demand for capital in these sectors is set to rise sharply. These investments are critical not only for meeting sustainability goals, but also for strengthening long-term energy and food security in India. Clean Mobility: Electrification of public and intercity transport- A capital investment opportunity of $200bn by 2030. Under the latest government mandate, all new buses procured under state and municipal schemes must be electric. With over 1.7 lakh buses set for replacement and an average cost of \u20b91 crore each, this translates into a \u20b91.7 lakh crore market opportunity in the public sector alone. A similar scale of opportunity exists in the private intercity bus segment, connecting metros like Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. Top OEMs including Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, and JBM Auto are expected to lead this shift. These players are also entering operations and maintenance, opening avenues for senior debt, equity capital, and structured financing. Green Energy transition: Industrial solar & battery storage: A capital investment opportunity of $200BN by 2030. Driven by global decarbonization targets\u2014especially in industries like steel and aluminium\u2014India Inc. is rapidly adopting dedicated solar plants and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). With export-dependent sectors preparing for EU\u2019s green steel mandates post-2030, clean energy integration is accelerating. To balance peak demand and grid stability, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are gaining momentum. Gujarat has already issued multi-thousand crore tenders, marking the beginning of a nationwide rollout. Circular Economy: Waste to value- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030. India\u2019s new extended producer responsibility (EPR) mandates are transforming the recycling industry. In the battery segment alone, 100% recovery compliance has made organized recycling not just viable but necessary. Lead-acid battery recycling is achieving over 97% efficiency, and similar circular systems are emerging for Plastics, lithium-ion batteries, tires, and e-waste under EPR scheme ( Extended Producers Responsibility). This shift is curbing hazardous informal processing and unlocking new revenue streams in regulated recycling ecosystems. Agriculture & Food Security: Modern silo infrastructure; Data centers & Green Tech Ecosystems- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030 The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is entering long-term \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d contracts with private players for high-tech grain silos, akin to the tank farms in oil and gas. These silos, strategically located across major agricultural belts, will store grains like rice, wheat, and pulses in scientifically designed, climate-resilient facilities, ensuring year-round food availability and minimizing wastage. India\u2019s growing digital economy is fuelling demand for green-powered data centers, which now serve as hubs integrating solar, wind, energy storage, and smart grid technologies. This emerging sector represents the convergence of digital and sustainable infrastructure, offering scalable and future-ready investment opportunities. 12:28 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live news: Himadri Speciality Chemical approves acquisition of 16.24% stake in International Battery Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on fully diluted basis.

This was made worse by Moody\u2019s recent reduction of the US credit rating because of growing debt levels and the Fed\u2019s cautious economic outlook. \u00b7 With the continuous turmoil in West Asia and President Trump\u2019s apparent retreat from mediating the Russia-Ukraine issue, geopolitical tensions further increased the allure of gold. \u00b7 In the meantime, Chinese customs statistics revealed that robust demand and the central bank\u2019s issuance of additional import quotas amid the height of US-China trade tensions caused gold imports to soar to an 11-month high of 127.5 metric tonnes in April, up 73% from March. Technical Triggers \u00b7 As gold has changed its momentum and moved higher above $3300 (~Rs 95500), the rally can continue towards $3380 (~Rs 97500), but prices are expected not to sustain beyond that. \u00b7 Silver prices are gaining momentum and close to their resistance level of $34(~Rs 99500). We could see a reversal if prices don\u2019t sustain. If prices sustain above these levels, the next target would be $35(~Rs 102,000). 11:54 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Highways Infrastructure Trust adds 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model highway projects from PNC Infratech Highways Infrastructure Trust (HIT), a SEBI-registered infrastructure investment trust, announces the addition of 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) highway projects from PNC Infratech Ltd to its portfolio.

We cut FY26-27 est. by 40% as we adjust for the inflated base profitability Rating downgrade due to path to 1% ROA now long drawn and business uncertainty The next event to monitor is the recommendation of new CEO by the Board to the RBI by 30th June ICICI Sec on IndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs650 Reports loss with weak core NIM/PPOP; growth/RoA revival yet uncertain Core profitability, adjusted for one-offs, was weak too with NIM at 3.47% (down 46bps QoQ) while PPOP slipped 24% YoY to INR 30.62bn. CET 1 and LCR levels are comfortable at 15.1% and 118%, respectively. The board is yet to recommend a name for its MD&CEO position to the RBI. We continue to believe that IIB would prioritise balance sheet stability vs. growth while the path to RoA revival remains uncertain, even if it was to get a signature hire. We believe, the bank would prioritise balance sheet liquidity/granularity; thus, it would likely report single-digit loan growth for FY26\u201327E. We estimate FY26 PPOP of ~INR 130bn, higher than annualised BAU Q4FY25 figures. We estimate ~1.6% credit costs for FY26/FY27, partly from its MFI portfolio (0\u201390dpd still elevated) and in a bid to shore-up contingent provisions (now nil). We estimate IIB to report <1% RoA and single-digit RoE for FY26/FY27 Investec on ndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs625 from Rs650 Cut earnings est by 40%/37% for FY26/27 Build in lower loan growth of 5%/10% for FY26/27 ROE outlook remains soft at 6%-7% IIB reported a PBT loss of Rs 30bn in 4Q, while also reporting a loss at the PPOP level of Rs 4.9bn. Bank highlighted negative P&L impact of Rs 49bn, relating to fraud committed by employees, much higher than Rs 26.5bn previously disclosed (for over-reported derivatives income and MFI interest) NII was down 43% YoY, which after adjusting for one-time hits was down 13% YoY (adjusted NIM at 3.5% down 45bp QoQ). This along with softer fees meant normalized PPOP (~Rs 27bn) was down 35% YoY and PPOP-level RoA is now at a soft 1.9% Slippages at Rs 50bn (5.9% vs 2.7% in 3Q) were elevated led by high MFI delinquencies (Rs 35bn of which Rs 19bn was driven by recognition of \u2018misclassified\u2019 loans). Bank\u2019s disclosures recognise fraud committed by \u2018certain employees having a significant role in accounting and financial reporting of the Bank\u2019. The P&L impact from these (recognised in 4Q) is shown in Fig 3. Bank highlighted that it is in the process of hiring a prospective CEO, for which it plans to submit names to RBI by 30 June 2025. We factor in softer PPOP UBS on IndusInd Sell, TP Rs 600 Q4 : Weak amidst uncertainty MFI loans had largest contribution to total -ve one-offs Board to recommend possible CEO names to RBI before 30th June Stk not inexpensive at current levels & uncertainty likely to result in derating MS on Indusind Downgrade to Underweight with Equal-weight; Cut TP to Rs 700 from Rs 755 Bear Case Playing Out Expected sharp NII miss post recent disclosures but were negatively surprised by incorrectly classified MFI slippages High margin loan mix is moving lower and will weigh on RoA recovery Expect gradual earnings recovery on a weak starting point Valuation at 0.9x FY26 book is not cheap in the context of 7-10% RoE that we expect over next two years Macquarie on Indusind Maintain Outperform with TP of Rs 1210 Q4: Large earnings miss, multiple events recognized Asset quality still a concern If one assumes that cleanup is largely done, which in itself is questionable, normalised PPOP was Rs 12000 cr annualised for Q4 Stock currently at 5x trailing PPOP, which is lower than peers Further, on a trailing book, the stock trades at 0.9x FY25 P/B Clarity around management succession, peak credit costs, sustainable NIMs, and governance are key monitorables CLSA on Indusind Maintain Hold; Cut TP to Rs 725 from Rs 780 A quarter to forget Core profitability muted; several one-offs lead to Rs22bn loss Core slippages in MFI elevated, but other segments stable FY26 to be a year of uncertainty Jefferies on Indusind Maintain Buy; Cut TP to Rs 920 from Rs 1040 Clean-up was larger than anticipated Exit run-rate of business is low; the new CEO is to lay a path forward Valuations are reasonable HSBC on Indusind Downgrade to Reduce from Buy; Hike TP to Rs 660 from Rs 770 IndusInd has effectively been pushed back to the pre-2009 era Right now, there is no clarity on the rebuilding process Cut FY26-27 EPS estimates by 41-43% as management has made one-off adjustments to correct accounting discrepancies MS on Interglobe Aviation OW, TP Raised to Rs 6502 4QF25 EBITDA of Rs59.5bn was 13% ahead of estimate.
