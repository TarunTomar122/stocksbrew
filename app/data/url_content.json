Clean Mobility: Electrification of public and intercity transport- A capital investment opportunity of $200bn by 2030. Under the latest government mandate, all new buses procured under state and municipal schemes must be electric. With over 1.7 lakh buses set for replacement and an average cost of \u20b91 crore each, this translates into a \u20b91.7 lakh crore market opportunity in the public sector alone. A similar scale of opportunity exists in the private intercity bus segment, connecting metros like Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. Top OEMs including Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, and JBM Auto are expected to lead this shift. These players are also entering operations and maintenance, opening avenues for senior debt, equity capital, and structured financing. Green Energy transition: Industrial solar & battery storage: A capital investment opportunity of $200BN by 2030. Driven by global decarbonization targets\u2014especially in industries like steel and aluminium\u2014India Inc. is rapidly adopting dedicated solar plants and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). With export-dependent sectors preparing for EU\u2019s green steel mandates post-2030, clean energy integration is accelerating. To balance peak demand and grid stability, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are gaining momentum. Gujarat has already issued multi-thousand crore tenders, marking the beginning of a nationwide rollout. Circular Economy: Waste to value- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030. India\u2019s new extended producer responsibility (EPR) mandates are transforming the recycling industry. In the battery segment alone, 100% recovery compliance has made organized recycling not just viable but necessary. Lead-acid battery recycling is achieving over 97% efficiency, and similar circular systems are emerging for Plastics, lithium-ion batteries, tires, and e-waste under EPR scheme ( Extended Producers Responsibility). This shift is curbing hazardous informal processing and unlocking new revenue streams in regulated recycling ecosystems. Agriculture & Food Security: Modern silo infrastructure; Data centers & Green Tech Ecosystems- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030 The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is entering long-term \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d contracts with private players for high-tech grain silos, akin to the tank farms in oil and gas. These silos, strategically located across major agricultural belts, will store grains like rice, wheat, and pulses in scientifically designed, climate-resilient facilities, ensuring year-round food availability and minimizing wastage. India\u2019s growing digital economy is fuelling demand for green-powered data centers, which now serve as hubs integrating solar, wind, energy storage, and smart grid technologies. This emerging sector represents the convergence of digital and sustainable infrastructure, offering scalable and future-ready investment opportunities. 12:28 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live news: Himadri Speciality Chemical approves acquisition of 16.24% stake in International Battery Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on fully diluted basis.

This was made worse by Moody\u2019s recent reduction of the US credit rating because of growing debt levels and the Fed\u2019s cautious economic outlook. \u00b7 With the continuous turmoil in West Asia and President Trump\u2019s apparent retreat from mediating the Russia-Ukraine issue, geopolitical tensions further increased the allure of gold. \u00b7 In the meantime, Chinese customs statistics revealed that robust demand and the central bank\u2019s issuance of additional import quotas amid the height of US-China trade tensions caused gold imports to soar to an 11-month high of 127.5 metric tonnes in April, up 73% from March. Technical Triggers \u00b7 As gold has changed its momentum and moved higher above $3300 (~Rs 95500), the rally can continue towards $3380 (~Rs 97500), but prices are expected not to sustain beyond that. \u00b7 Silver prices are gaining momentum and close to their resistance level of $34(~Rs 99500). We could see a reversal if prices don\u2019t sustain. If prices sustain above these levels, the next target would be $35(~Rs 102,000). 11:54 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Highways Infrastructure Trust adds 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model highway projects from PNC Infratech Highways Infrastructure Trust (HIT), a SEBI-registered infrastructure investment trust, announces the addition of 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) highway projects from PNC Infratech Ltd to its portfolio.

We cut FY26-27 est. by 40% as we adjust for the inflated base profitability Rating downgrade due to path to 1% ROA now long drawn and business uncertainty The next event to monitor is the recommendation of new CEO by the Board to the RBI by 30th June ICICI Sec on IndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs650 Reports loss with weak core NIM/PPOP; growth/RoA revival yet uncertain Core profitability, adjusted for one-offs, was weak too with NIM at 3.47% (down 46bps QoQ) while PPOP slipped 24% YoY to INR 30.62bn. CET 1 and LCR levels are comfortable at 15.1% and 118%, respectively. The board is yet to recommend a name for its MD&CEO position to the RBI. We continue to believe that IIB would prioritise balance sheet stability vs. growth while the path to RoA revival remains uncertain, even if it was to get a signature hire. We believe, the bank would prioritise balance sheet liquidity/granularity; thus, it would likely report single-digit loan growth for FY26\u201327E. We estimate FY26 PPOP of ~INR 130bn, higher than annualised BAU Q4FY25 figures. We estimate ~1.6% credit costs for FY26/FY27, partly from its MFI portfolio (0\u201390dpd still elevated) and in a bid to shore-up contingent provisions (now nil). We estimate IIB to report <1% RoA and single-digit RoE for FY26/FY27 Investec on ndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs625 from Rs650 Cut earnings est by 40%/37% for FY26/27 Build in lower loan growth of 5%/10% for FY26/27 ROE outlook remains soft at 6%-7% IIB reported a PBT loss of Rs 30bn in 4Q, while also reporting a loss at the PPOP level of Rs 4.9bn. Bank highlighted negative P&L impact of Rs 49bn, relating to fraud committed by employees, much higher than Rs 26.5bn previously disclosed (for over-reported derivatives income and MFI interest) NII was down 43% YoY, which after adjusting for one-time hits was down 13% YoY (adjusted NIM at 3.5% down 45bp QoQ). This along with softer fees meant normalized PPOP (~Rs 27bn) was down 35% YoY and PPOP-level RoA is now at a soft 1.9% Slippages at Rs 50bn (5.9% vs 2.7% in 3Q) were elevated led by high MFI delinquencies (Rs 35bn of which Rs 19bn was driven by recognition of \u2018misclassified\u2019 loans). Bank\u2019s disclosures recognise fraud committed by \u2018certain employees having a significant role in accounting and financial reporting of the Bank\u2019. The P&L impact from these (recognised in 4Q) is shown in Fig 3. Bank highlighted that it is in the process of hiring a prospective CEO, for which it plans to submit names to RBI by 30 June 2025. We factor in softer PPOP UBS on IndusInd Sell, TP Rs 600 Q4 : Weak amidst uncertainty MFI loans had largest contribution to total -ve one-offs Board to recommend possible CEO names to RBI before 30th June Stk not inexpensive at current levels & uncertainty likely to result in derating MS on Indusind Downgrade to Underweight with Equal-weight; Cut TP to Rs 700 from Rs 755 Bear Case Playing Out Expected sharp NII miss post recent disclosures but were negatively surprised by incorrectly classified MFI slippages High margin loan mix is moving lower and will weigh on RoA recovery Expect gradual earnings recovery on a weak starting point Valuation at 0.9x FY26 book is not cheap in the context of 7-10% RoE that we expect over next two years Macquarie on Indusind Maintain Outperform with TP of Rs 1210 Q4: Large earnings miss, multiple events recognized Asset quality still a concern If one assumes that cleanup is largely done, which in itself is questionable, normalised PPOP was Rs 12000 cr annualised for Q4 Stock currently at 5x trailing PPOP, which is lower than peers Further, on a trailing book, the stock trades at 0.9x FY25 P/B Clarity around management succession, peak credit costs, sustainable NIMs, and governance are key monitorables CLSA on Indusind Maintain Hold; Cut TP to Rs 725 from Rs 780 A quarter to forget Core profitability muted; several one-offs lead to Rs22bn loss Core slippages in MFI elevated, but other segments stable FY26 to be a year of uncertainty Jefferies on Indusind Maintain Buy; Cut TP to Rs 920 from Rs 1040 Clean-up was larger than anticipated Exit run-rate of business is low; the new CEO is to lay a path forward Valuations are reasonable HSBC on Indusind Downgrade to Reduce from Buy; Hike TP to Rs 660 from Rs 770 IndusInd has effectively been pushed back to the pre-2009 era Right now, there is no clarity on the rebuilding process Cut FY26-27 EPS estimates by 41-43% as management has made one-off adjustments to correct accounting discrepancies MS on Interglobe Aviation OW, TP Raised to Rs 6502 4QF25 EBITDA of Rs59.5bn was 13% ahead of estimate.

Help us understand a little bit about some of these tyre stocks that we have seen, JK Tyre for example in focus today, a 12.5% uptick coming in, very sharp uptick coming in on this stock. What are you making of this tyre space, the rubber space right now since commodities are slightly pressured? Give us a sense on what you are making on these rubber beneficiaries as well as some of the crude beneficiaries given that crude is once again trying to find its footing. Anshul Saigal: Generally, it is a statement within the investment management community that if you are positive on autos, buy tyres, what that means is that you do not know whether EVs will do well or the erstwhile engine companies will do well, but if either of those do well, tyre as a result will be beneficiaries. And to top it all, here you have the play on commodity because rubber prices decide whether tyre companies make healthy margins or no. And if rubber prices ease off, then clearly that impacts margins positively. As you rightly mentioned rubber prices have been kind of easing off in recent times and as a result, we are seeing and what we have noticed in recent times in stock price performance as also margin performance and time will tell whether this continues or not, but by and large if you are positive on the auto sector, then this is the space to be in. Live Events Just wanted to have your take on these cap good companies because for today what we are seeing is that for a stock like Siemens, there has been no stopping, after that analyst meet and the company is quite positive across the board, they are expecting a margin recovery as well. The stock has shot up around 5%. In the earnings, we have seen and specifically, I remember it for Siemens that though the net profit was below the street estimates, there was a dip of close to 40%, but the management commentary is really giving confidence to the investors, not just the Siemens other than that if we look at ABB India , all these counters have been holding up quite well. Do you believe it is once again time to look out for these names or the valuations is not giving that much of a comfort here? Anshul Saigal: So, if you look at these companies you are right, the results were slightly weak for the quarter, but then if you look at both the commentary and the order book release of many of these companies, you will notice that the tailwinds are just not stopping on order inflows in these companies, that is giving you a signal that this is not a flash in the pan that these companies are seeing so much growth or they have seen so much growth over the last three-four years. What our assessment is that the sort of speed bump that we saw in capacity addition in the period say 2012 to 2021, that speed bump will need a lot of catching up going forward and with themes like Make in India, Atmanirbhar Bharat as also attracting manufacturing into the country which is a policy of this government now. The next five-seven years are going to be tremendous for capacity addition in the country. Now, as a result, companies like the ones that you mentioned they are going to see significant tailwinds in demand. A quarter here, a quarter there they may see earning slowdown, revenue degrowth or whatever, but over a longish period these companies will see significant tailwind. And clearly the commentary of management of this one company is indicating that. We tend to concur that this is a sector which will have a long runway for growth and where investor interest will also remain quite strong going forward.

In case of gold prices in the international markets, there was a significant uptick during the week, rising approximately 3% to reach USD 3,303.92/Oz as of early Friday. This can be attributed to weakening dollar which saw depreciation of over 1% this week, followed by growing investor concerns regarding the fiscal outlook of the US. Domestically, gold price surpassed INR 96,000/10gms and remain range-bound between INR 93,000/10 gm to INR 96,000/10gms during the week. This was owing to the ripple effects of the international factors at play that fueled gold prices in the domestic market. Silver, on the other hand, saw 0.1% increase with prices hovering at USD 33.12/Oz in international market. Domestically, silver prices stood at INR 98,000/kg. This can be attributed to the cautious investor sentiments followed by global commodity trends and price movements. Moving forward to next week, the outlook for gold remains bullish with a possibility for a potential short-term correction. International Prices are expected to trade in the range of USD 3300-3400/Oz, supported by ongoing geopolitical tensions and uncertain outlook over US fiscal policies signaling economic instability in the biggest economy of the world. Domestic Prices can hover in the range of INR 95,000-96,000/10 gms.

Stock market live updates today: Morgan Stanley Strategists say buy America except the Dollar Morgan Stanley has raised its call on US stocks and Treasuries on expectations that a slew of future interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will support bonds and boost company earnings. The Wall Street bank has turned overweight on American stocks and sovereign bonds from a neutral stance, according to a note from strategists including Serena Tang, global head of cross-asset strategy research. The S&P 500 Index will reach 6,500 by the second quarter of 2026, while the yield on 10-year Treasuries will drop to 3.45%, they said. However, the dollar should continue to weaken thanks to a \u201cconvergence in US rates and growth to peers,\u201d the strategists wrote in the note dated May 20. Morgan Stanley\u2019s latest outlook comes as US markets recover from the losses brought on by President Donald Trump\u2019s global trade war in April. Investors now have to navigate the fading appeal of US exceptionalism, wait on tariffs negotiations and fractious budget talks on Capitol Hill, while weighing the potential for rate cuts. \u201cWe think that stocks won\u2019t revisit the lows of April in the near term, especially since the large drawdowns experienced year to date have mainly been reactions to tariff shock-and-awe,\u201d the strategists wrote. \u201cOur equity strategists see the future US policy agenda to be more accommodating, and expect the seven Fed cuts our economists anticipate for 2026 to be supportive of higher-than-average valuations.\u201d The S&P 500 has recouped losses brought on by Trump\u2019s Liberation Day after he clawed back most tariff increases while trade talks start. It closed at 5,940 on Tuesday. Yields on Treasuries though have continued to gain, with the 10-year trading at 4.51%, on concern that proposed tax cuts will widen the US budget deficit. \u201cDespite unprecedented policy uncertainty, the global economy is still in expansion mode, albeit with slowing growth,\u201d the strategists wrote in the note. \u201cSubstantial monetary easing is ahead along with the benefits of deregulation.\u201d 08:13 | May 23, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Economic Calendar \u2013 23.05.2025 11:30 U.K. Retail sales m/m (Expected: 0.4% versus Previous: 0.4%) 19:30 U.S. New Home

Monarch Networth \u2013 Clean Science & Technology Ltd.\u2013 Q4FY25 Results - Strengthening growth outlook through new launches CMP: INR 1,322 | TP: INR 1,560 | Rating: BUY - Q4FY25 revenue grew at 15.9% YoY and 9.5% QoQ, driven primarily by strong volume growth new product launches, and partially offset due to pricing pressures. EBITDA margin compressed by 180 bps YoY and 116bps QoQ due to change in product mix. - CSTL has made visible progress in its HALS, with sales growing from 600 tons in FY24 (INR 250mn) to ~2,000 tons in FY25 (INR 800mn). We expect volumes to more than double by FY26, reaching peak capacity by FY28E. - Company\u2019s diversification efforts are progressing well, with meaningful capacity additions across new growth areas. The company is undertaking incremental capex of INR 3bn for two performance chemicals, expected to be commissioned by H2FY26. - We have reduced our estimates to address the revised capex plans and gradual improvement in contribution from the new products.

Here\u2019s why Trends Markets have displayed resilience after the pause of Trump tariffs on April 9, 2025 and led a comeback of the Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) which has helped market stabilize. Geojit Investments' VK Vijayakumar explains how largecap superiority has dominated the institutional mind off-late. He said that there is a big shift in market preference in favour of largecaps away from overvalued segments of mid and smallcaps is significant. FIIs are mainly buying largecaps and this trend can continue, he opined. Puneet Sharma, CEO and Fund Manager at Whitespace Alpha said that smallcaps have remained in preference for retail investors and domestic mutual fund story at this point, with FIIs staying cautious due to elevated valuations and limited liquidity headroom. Valuations: Largecaps Vs Midcaps Vs Smallcaps JM Financial in a note said that large, mid and small cap indices are all trading one standard or more above the mean, which implies that absolute valuations are not cheap. \"Looking at FY26E absolute P/E, one might interpret that relatively midcaps are the most expensive (Nifty Midcap 100 at 29.3x), followed by small caps (Nifty Smallcap at 25.2x), and large caps being the cheapest (Nifty50 at 20.6x),\" a brokerage note said. But the note also sees midcaps to be the cheapest (Nifty Midcap 100 at 1.3x) in terms of FY26E PEG followed by small caps (Nifty Smallcap 100x at 1.7x) and the largecaps being the most expensive (Nifty50 at 1.9x).

Rube Goldberg machine A Rube Goldberg machine , contraption , invention , device , or apparatus is a deliberately over-engineered or overdone machine that performs a very simple task in a very complex fashion, usually including a chain reaction . The expression is named after American cartoonist and inventor Rube Goldberg (1883\u20131970). Over the years, the expression has expanded to mean any confusing or complicated system. For example, news headlines include \"Is Rep. Bill Thomas the Rube Goldberg of Legislative Reform?\" [ 1 ] and \"Retirement 'insurance' as a Rube Goldberg machine\". [ 2 ] Origin Professor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin Rube Goldberg's cartoons became well known for depicting complex devices that performed simple tasks in indirect, convoluted ways. The example on the right is Goldberg's \"Professor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin\", which was later reprinted in the a few book collections, including the postcard book Rube Goldberg's Inventions! and the hardcover Rube Goldberg: Inventions , both compiled by Maynard Frank Wolfe from the Rube Goldberg Archives. [ 3 ] The \"Self-Operating Napkin\" is activated when soup spoon (A) is raised to mouth, pulling string (B) and thereby jerking ladle (C), which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E). Parrot jumps after cracker and perch (F) tilts, upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H). Extra weight in pail pulls cord (I), which opens and lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K) which causes sickle (L) to cut string (M) and allow pendulum with attached napkin to swing back and forth, thereby wiping chin. In 1931, the Merriam\u2013Webster dictionary adopted the word \"Rube Goldberg\" as an adjective defined as accomplishing something simple through complex means. [ 4 ] Similar expressions worldwide Australia \u2014 cartoonist Bruce Petty depicts such themes as the economy, international relations or other social issues as complex interlocking machines that manipulate, or are manipulated by, people. Austria \u2014 Franz Gsellmann worked for decades on a machine that he named the Weltmaschine (\"world machine\"), [ 5 ] having many similarities to a Rube Goldberg machine. Czech Republic \u2014 such machines are often called \"Raketopl\u00e1n\" ( \"Space Shuttle\" ) mainly in the IT industry describing simple tasks being solved with unnecessary complex and expensive solutions. Denmark \u2014 called Storm P maskiner (\"Storm P machines\"), after the Danish inventor and cartoonist Robert Storm Petersen . France \u2014 a similar machine is called usine \u00e0 gaz , or gas refinery, suggesting a very complicated factory with pipes running everywhere. It is now used mainly among programmers to indicate a complex program, or in journalism to refer to a bewildering law or regulation. Germany \u2014 such machines are often called \"Was-passiert-dann-Maschine\" ( \"What happens next machine\" ) for the German name of similar devices used by Kermit the Frog in the children's TV show Sesame Street . Great Britain \u2014 a Heath Robinson contraption, named after the fantastical comic machinery illustrated by British cartoonist W. Heath Robinson, shares a similar meaning but predates the Rube Goldberg machine, originating in the UK in 1912. [ 6 ] India \u2014 the humorist and children's author Sukumar Ray , in his nonsense poem \"Abol tabol\", had a character (Uncle) with a Rube Goldberg-like machine called \"Uncle's contraption\"( khuror kol ). This word is used colloquially in Bengali to mean a complex and useless object. Japan \u2014 \"Pythagorean devices\" or \"Pythagoras switch\". PythagoraSwitch (\u30d4\u30bf\u30b4\u30e9\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1, \" Pitagora Suicchi \") is the name of a TV show featuring such devices. Another related phenomenon is the Japanese art of chind\u014dgu, which involves inventions that are hypothetically useful but of limited actual utility. Norway \u2014 cartoonist and storyteller Kjell Aukrust created a cartoon character named Reodor Felgen , who constantly invented complex machinery. Though it was often built out of unlikely parts, it always performed very well. Felgen stars as the inventor of an extremely powerful but overly complex car, Il Tempo Gigante , in the Ivo Caprino animated puppet film Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix (1975). Spain \u2014 devices akin to Goldberg's machines are known as Inventos del TBO (tebeo) , named after those that several cartoonists ( Nit, T\u00ednez, Marino Benejam, Frances Tur and finally Ram\u00f3n Sabat\u00e9s) made up and drew for a section in the TBO magazine , allegedly designed by some \"Professor Franz\" from Copenhagen . Turkey \u2014 such devices are known as Zihni Sinir Proceleri , allegedly invented by a certain Prof. Zihni Sinir (\"Crabby Mind\"), a curious scientist character created by \u0130rfan Sayar in 1977 for the cartoon magazine G\u0131rg\u0131r . The cartoonist later went on to open a studio selling actual working implementations of his designs. Professional artists Tim Hawkinson (not to be confused with Tim Hawkins), has made several art pieces that contain complex apparatuses that are generally used to make abstract art or music. Many of them are centered around the randomness of other devices (such as a slot machine ) and are dependent on them to create some menial effect. Peter Fischli & David Weiss , Swiss artists known for their movie Der Lauf der Dinge ( The Way Things Go ). Competitions Rube Goldberg machine designers participating in a competition in New Mexico. In early 1987, Purdue University in Indiana started the annual National Rube Goldberg Machine Contest , organized by the Phi Chapter of Theta Tau , a national engineering fraternity. In 2009, the Epsilon Chapter of Theta Tau established a similar annual contest at the University of California, Berkeley . Since around 1997, the kinetic artist Arthur Ganson has been the emcee of the annual \"Friday After Thanksgiving\" (FAT) competition sponsored by the MIT Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts . Teams of contestants construct elaborate Rube Goldberg style chain-reaction machines on tables arranged around a large gymnasium. Each apparatus is linked by a string to its predecessor and successor machine. The initial string is ceremonially pulled, and the ensuing events are videotaped in closeup, and simultaneously projected on large screens for viewing by the live audience. After the entire cascade of events has finished, prizes are then awarded in various categories and age levels. Videos from several previous years' contests are viewable on the MIT Museum website. [ 7 ] On Food Network's TV show \"Challenge\", competitors in 2011 were once required to create a Rube Goldberg machine out of sugar. [ citation needed ] One of the events in Science Olympiad involves students building a Rube Goldberg-like device to perform a certain series of tasks. In April 2012, the Bosch company hosted an event called the \"Playground of Engineers\" in Hungary where the participant teams had to perform a series of tasks wherein they collected coins. Later that day, the main challenge was to build an overly complex Goldberg Machine, the goal of which was to switch on a car dashboard. The teams were able to buy additional items with their collected coins above the standard issue equipment to make their machine more complicated. The main criteria of the judges were complexity, operating time and the number of components used.

This is because it has not been established in one's mind\n          beforehand. From this, one's unmindfulness of the Way can be known. Negligence is an extreme thing.  The Way of the Samurai is found in death. When it comes to either/or,\n          there is only the quick choice of death. It is not particularly\n          difficult. Be determined and advance. To say that dying without\n          reaching one's aim is to die a dog's death is the frivolous way of\n          sophisticates. When pressed with the choice of life or death, it is\n          not necessary to gain one's aim. We all want to live. And in large part we make our logic according to\n          what we like. But not having attained our aim and continuing to live\n          is cowardice. This is a thin dangerous line. To die without gaining\n          one's aim\n          is a dog's death and fanaticism. But there is no shame in this.\n          This is the substance of the Way of the Samurai. If by setting one's\n          heart right every morning and evening, one is able to live as though\n          one's aim is a dog's death and fanaticism. But there is no\n          shame in this. This is the substance of the Way of the Samurai. If by\n          setting one's heart right every morning and evening, one is able to\n          live as though his body were already dead, he gains freedom in the\n          Way. His whole life will be without blame, and he will succeed in his\n          calling.  A man is a good retainer to the extent that he earnestly places\n          importance in his master. This is the highest sort of retainer. If one\n          is born into a prominent family that goes back for generations, it is\n          sufficient to deeply consider the matter of obligation to one's\n          ancestors, to lay down one's body and mind, and to earnestly esteem\n          one's master. It is further good fortune if, more than this, one has\n          wisdom and talent and can use them appropriately. But even a person\n          who is good for nothing and exceedingly clumsy will be a reliable\n          retainer if only he has the determination to think earnestly of his\n          master. Having only wisdom and talent is the lowest tier of\n          usefulness.  According to their nature, there are both people who have quick\n          intelligence, and those who must withdraw and take time to think\n          things over. Looking into this thoroughly, if one thinks selflessly\n          and adheres to the four vows of the Nabeshima samurai, surprising\n          wisdom will occur regardless of the high or low points of one's\n          nature. People think that they can clear up profound matters if they consider\n          them deeply, but they exercise perverse thoughts and come to no good\n          because they do their reflecting with only self-interest at the\n          center. It is difficult for a fool's habits to change to selflessness. In\n          confronting a matter, however, if at first you leave it alone, fix the\n          four vows in your heart, exclude self-interest, and make an effort,\n          you will not go far from your mark.  Because we do most things relying only on our own sagacity we become\n          self-interested, turn our backs on reason, and things do not turn out\n          well. As seen by other people this is sordid, weak, narrow, and\n          inefficient. When one is not capable of true intelligence, it is good\n          to consult with someone of good sense. An advisor will fulfill the Way\n          when he makes a decision by selfless and frank intelligence because he\n          is not personally involved. This way of doing things will certainly be\n          seen by others as being strongly rooted. It is, for example, like a\n          large tree with many roots. One man's intelligence is like a tree that\n          has been simply stuck in the ground.  We learn about the sayings and deeds of the men of old in order to\n          entrust ourselves to their wisdom and prevent selfishness. When we\n          throw off our own bias, follow the sayings of the ancients, and confer\n          with other people, matters should go well and without mishap. Lord\n          Katsushige borrowed from the wisdom of Lord Naoshige. This is\n          mentioned in the\n          Ohanashikikigaki. We should be grateful for his concern. Moreover, there was a certain man who engaged a number of his younger\n          brothers as retainers, and whenever he visited Edo or the Kamigata\n          area, he would have them accompany him. As he consulted with them\n          everyday on both private and public matters, it is said that he was\n          without mishap.  Sagara Ky\u016bma was completely at one with his master and served him as\n          though his own body were already dead. He was one man in a thousand. Once there was an important meeting at Master Saky\u014d's Mizugae Villa,\n          and it was commanded that Ky\u016bma was to commit seppuku. At that time in\n          \u014csaki there was a tea-house on the third floor of the suburban\n          residence of Master Taku Nui. Ky\u016bma rented this, and gathering\n          together all the good-for-nothings in Saga, he put on a puppet show,\n          operating one of the puppets himself, carousing and drinking all day\n          and night. Thus, overlooking Master Saky\u014d's villa, he carried on and\n          caused a great disturbance. In instigating this disaster he gallantly\n          thought only of his master and was resolved to committing suicide.  Being a retainer is nothing other than being a supporter of one's\n          lord, entrusting matters of good and evil to him, and renouncing\n          self-interest. If there are but two or three men of this type, the\n          fief will be secure. If one looks at the world when affairs are going smoothly, there are\n          many who go about putting in their appearance, being useful by their\n          wisdom, discrimination, and artfulness. However, if the lord should\n          retire or go into seclusion, there are many who will quickly turn\n          their backs on him and ingratiate themselves to the man of the day.\n          Such a thing is unpleasant even to think about. Men of high position,\n          low position, deep wisdom, and artfulness all feel that\n          they are the ones who are working righteously, but when it\n          comes to the point of throwing away one's life for his lord, all get\n          weak in the knees. This is rather disgraceful. The fact that a useless\n          person often becomes a matchless warrior at such times is because he\n          has already given up his life and has become one with his lord. At the\n          time of Mitsushige's death there was an example of this. His one\n          resolved attendant was I alone. The others followed in my wake. Always\n          the pretentious, self-asserting notables turn their backs on the man\n          just as his eyes are closing in death. Loyalty is said to be important in the pledge between lord and\n          retainer. Though it may seem unobtainable, it is right before your\n          eyes. If you once set yourself to it, you will become a superb\n          retainer at that very moment.  To give a person one's opinion and correct his faults is an important\n          thing. It is compassionate and comes first in matters of service. But\n          the way of doing this is extremely difficult. To discover the good and\n          bad points of a person is an easy thing, and to give an opinion\n          concerning them is easy, too. For the most part, people think that\n          they are being kind by saying the things that others find distasteful\n          or difficult to say. But if it is not received well, they think that\n          there is nothing more to be done. This is completely worthless. It is\n          the same as bringing shame to a person by slandering him. It is\n          nothing more than getting it off one's chest. To give a person an opinion one must first judge well whether that\n          person is of the disposition to receive it or not. One must become\n          close with him and make sure that he continually trusts one's word.\n          Approaching subjects that are dear to him, seek the best way to speak\n          and to be well understood. Judge the occasion, and determine whether\n          it is better by letter or at the time of leave-taking. Praise his good\n          points and use every device to encourage him, perhaps by talking about\n          one's own faults without touching on his, but so that they will occur\n          to him. Have him receive this in the way that a man would drink water\n          when his throat is dry, and it will be an opinion that will correct\n          faults. This is extremely difficult. If a person's fault is a habit of some\n          years prior, by and large it won't be remedied. I have had this\n          experience myself. To be intimate with all one's comrades, correcting\n          each other's faults, and being of one mind to be of use to the master\n          is the great compassion of a retainer. By bringing shame to a person,\n          how could one expect to make him a better man?  It is bad taste to yawn in front of people. When one unexpectedly has\n          to yawn, if he rubs his forehead in an upward direction, the sensation\n          will stop. If that does not work, he can lick his lips while keeping\n          his mouth closed, or simply hide it with his hand or his sleeve in\n          such a way that no one will know what he is doing. It is the same with\n          sneezing. One will appear foolish. There are other things besides\n          these about which a person should use care and training.  When a certain person was saying that present matters of economy\n          should be detailed, someone replied that this is not good at all. It\n          is a fact that fish will not live where the water is too clear. But if\n          there is duckweed or something, the fish will hide under its shadow\n          and thrive. Thus, the lower classes will live in tranquility if\n          certain matters are a bit overlooked or left unheard. This fact should\n          be understood with regard to people's conduct.  Once when Lord Mitsushige was a little boy and was supposed to recite\n          from a copybook for the priest Kaion, he called the other children and\n          acolytes and said, \"Please come here and listen. It's difficult to\n          read if there are hardly any people listening.\" The priest was\n          impressed and said to the acolytes, \"That's the spirit in which to do\n          everything.\"  Every morning one should first do reverence to his master and parents\n          and then to his patron deities and guardian Buddhas. If he will only\n          make his master first in importance, his parents will rejoice and the\n          gods and Buddhas will give their assent. For a warrior there is\n          nothing other than thinking of his master. If one creates this\n          resolution within himself, he will always be mindful of the master's\n          person and will not depart from him even for a moment. Moreover, a woman should consider her husband first, just as he\n          considers his master first.  According to a certain person, a number of years ago, the late\n          Matsuguma Ky\u014dan told this story: In the practice of medicine there is a differentiation of treatment\n          according to the Yin and Yang of men and women. There is also a\n          difference in pulse. In the last fifty years, however, men's pulse has\n          become the same as women's. Noticing this, in the treatment of eye\n          disease I applied women's treatment to men and found it suitable. When\n          I observed the application of men's treatment to men, there was no\n          result. Thus I knew that men's spirit had weakened and that they had\n          become the same as women, and the end of the world had come. Since I\n          witnessed this with certainty, I kept it a secret. When looking at the men of today with this in mind, those who could be\n          thought to have a woman's pulse are many indeed, and those who seem\n          like real men few. Because of this, if one were to make a little\n          effort, he would be able to take the upper hand quite easily. That\n          there are few men who are able to cut well in beheadings is further\n          proof that men's courage has waned. And when one comes to speak of\n          kaishaku, it has become an age of men who are prudent and\n          clever at making excuses. Forty or fifty years ago, when such things\n          as matanuki were considered manly, a man wouldn't show an\n          unscarred thigh to his fellows, so he would pierce it himself. All of man's work is a bloody business. That fact, today, is\n          considered foolish, affairs are finished cleverly with words alone,\n          and jobs that require effort are avoided. I would like young men to\n          have some understanding of this.  The priest Tannen used to say, \"People come to no understanding\n          because priests teach only the doctrine of 'No Mind.' What is called\n          'No Mind' is a mind that is pure and lacks complication.\" This is\n          interesting. Lord Sanenori said, \"In the midst of a single breath, where perversity\n          cannot be held, is the Way.\" If so, then the Way is one. But there is\n          no one who can understand this clarity at first. Purity is something\n          that cannot be attained except by piling effort upon effort.  There is nothing that we should be quite so grateful for as the last\n          line of the poem that goes \"When your own heart asks.\" It can probably\n          be thought of in the same way as the Nembutsu, and previously\n          it was on the lips of many people. Recently, people who are called \"clever\" adorn themselves with\n          superficial wisdom and only deceive others. For this reason they are\n          inferior to dull-witted folk. A dull-witted person is direct. If one\n          looks deeply into his heart with the above phrase, there will be no\n          hidden places. It is a good examiner. One should be of the mind that,\n          meeting this examiner, he will not be embarrassed.  The word gen means \"illusion\" or \"apparition.\" In India, a man\n          The word gen means \"illusion\" or \"apparition.\" In India, a man\n          who uses conjury is called a genjutsushi [\"a master of illusion\n          technique\"]. Everything in this world is but a marionette show. Thus\n          we use the word gen.  To hate injustice and stand on righteousness is a difficult thing.\n          Furthermore, to think that being righteous is the best one can do and\n          to do one's utmost to be righteous will, on the contrary, bring many\n          mistakes. The Way is in a higher place than righteousness. This is\n          very difficult to discover, but it is the highest wisdom. When seen\n          from this standpoint, things like righteousness are rather shallow. If\n          one does not understand this on his own, it cannot be known. There is\n          a method of getting to this Way, however, even if one cannot discover\n          it by himself. This is found in consultation with others. Even a\n          person who has not attained this Way sees others from the side. It is\n          like the saying from the game of go: \"He who sees from the side\n          has eight eyes.\" The saying, \"Thought by thought we see our own\n          mistakes,\" also means that the highest Way is in discussion with\n          others. Listening to the old stories and reading books are for the\n          purpose of sloughing off one's own discrimination and attaching\n          oneself to that of the ancients.  A certain swordsman in his declining years said the following: In one's life, there are levels in the pursuit of study. In the lowest\n          level, a person studies but nothing comes of it, and he feels that\n          both he and others are unskillful. At this point he is worthless. In\n          the middle level he is still useless but is aware of his own\n          insufficiencies and can also see the insufficiencies of others. In a\n          higher level he has pride concerning his own ability, rejoices in\n          praise from others, and laments the lack of ability in his fellows.\n          This man has worth. In the highest level a man has the look of knowing\n          nothing. These are the levels in general. But there is one transcending level,\n          and this is the most excellent of all. This person is aware of the\n          endlessness of entering deeply into a certain Way and never thinks of\n          himself as having finished. He truly knows his own insufficiencies and\n          never in his whole life thinks that he has succeeded. He has no\n          thoughts of pride but with self-abasement knows the Way to the end. It\n          is said that Master Yagy\u016b once remarked, \"I do not know the way to\n          defeat others, but the way to defeat myself.\" Throughout your life advance daily, becoming more skillful than\n          yesterday, more skillful than today. This is never-ending.  Among the maxims on Lord Naoshige's wall there was this one: \"Matters\n          of great concern should be treated lightly.\" Master Ittei commented,\n          \"Matters of small concern should be treated seriously.\" Among one's\n          affairs there should not be more than two or three matters of what one\n          could call great concern. If these are deliberated upon during\n          ordinary times, they can be understood. Thinking about things\n          previously and then handling them lightly when the time comes is what\n          this is all about. To face an event and solve it lightly is difficult\n          if you are not resolved beforehand, and there will always be\n          uncertainty in hitting your mark. However, if the foundation is laid\n          previously, you can think of the saying, \"Matters of great concern\n          should be treated lightly,\" as your own basis for action.  A certain person spent several years of service in Osaka and then\n          returned home. When he made his appearance at the local bureau,\n          everyone was put out and he was made a laughingstock because he spoke\n          in the Kamigata dialect. Seen in this light, when one spends a long\n          time in Edo or the Kamigata area, he had better use his native dialect\n          even more than usual. [When in a more sophisticated area] it is natural that one's\n          disposition be affected by different styles. But it is vulgar and\n          foolish to look down upon the ways of one's own district as being\n          boorish, or to be even a bit open to the persuasion of the other\n          place's ways and to think about giving up one's own. That one's own\n          district is unsophisticated and unpolished is a great treasure.\n          Imitating another style is simply a sham. A certain man said to the priest Shungaku, \"The Lotus Sutra Sect's\n          character is not good because it's so fearsome.\" Shungaku replied, \"It is by reason of its fearsome character that it\n          is the Lotus Sutra Sect. If its character were not so, it would\n          be a different sect altogether.\" This is reasonable.  At the time when there was a council concerning the promotion of a\n          certain man, the council members were at the point of deciding that\n          promotion was useless because of the fact that the man had previously\n          been involved in a drunken brawl. But someone said, \"If we were to\n          cast aside every man who had made a mistake once, useful men could\n          probably not be come by. A man who makes a mistake once will be\n          considerably more prudent and useful because of his repentance. I feel\n          that he should be promoted.\" Someone else then asked, \"Will you guarantee him?\" The man replied, \"Of course I will.\" The others asked, \"By what will you guarantee him?\" And he replied, \"I can guarantee him by the fact that he is a man who\n          has erred once. A man who has never once erred is dangerous.\" This\n          said, the man was promoted.  At the time of a deliberation concerning criminals, Nakano Kazuma\n          proposed making the punishment one degree lighter than what would be\n          appropriate. This is a treasury of wisdom that only he was the\n          possessor of. At that time, though there were several men in\n          attendance, if it had not been for Kazuma alone, no one would have\n          opened his mouth. For this reason he is called Master Commencement and\n          Master Twenty-Five Days.  A certain person was brought to shame because he did not take revenge.\n          The way of revenge lies in simply forcing one's way into a place and\n          being cut down. There is no shame in this. By thinking that you must\n          complete the job you will run out of time. By considering things like\n          how many men the enemy has, time piles up; in the end you will give\n          up. No matter if the enemy has thousands of men, there is fulfillment in\n          simply standing them off and being determined to cut them all down,\n          starting from one end. You will finish the greater part of it. Concerning the night assault of Lord Asano's r\u014dnin, the fact that they\n          did not commit seppuku at the Sengakuji was an error, for there was a\n          long delay between the time their lord was struck down and the time\n          when they struck down the enemy. If Lord Kira had died of illness\n          within that period, it would have been extremely regrettable. Because\n          the men of the Kamigata area have a very clever sort of wisdom, they\n          do well at praiseworthy acts but cannot do things indiscriminately, as\n          was done in the Nagasaki fight. Although all things are not to be judged in this manner, I mention it\n          in the investigation of the Way of the Samurai. When the time comes,\n          there is no moment for reasoning. And if you have not done your\n          inquiring beforehand, there is most often shame. Reading books and\n          listening to people's talk are for the purpose of prior resolution. Above all, the Way of the Samurai should be in being aware that you do\n          not know what is going to happen next, and in querying every item day\n          and night. Victory and defeat are matters of the temporary force of\n          circumstances. The way of avoiding shame is different. It is simply in\n          death. Even if it seems certain that you will lose, retaliate. Neither wisdom\n          nor technique has a place in this. A real man does not think of\n          victory or defeat. He plunges recklessly towards an irrational death.\n          By doing this, you will awaken from your dreams.  There are two things that will blemish a retainer, and these are\n          riches and honor. If one but remains in strained circumstances, he\n          will not be marred. Once there was a certain man who was very clever, but it was his\n          character to always see the negative points of his jobs. In such a\n          way, one will be useless. If one does not get it into his head from\n          the very beginning that the world is full of unseemly situations, for\n          the most part his demeanor will be poor and he will not be believed by\n          others. And if one is not believed by others, no matter how good a\n          person he may be, he will not have the essence of a good person. This\n          can also be considered as a blemish.  There was a man who said, \"Such and such a person has a violent\n          disposition, but this is what I said right to his face. . . .\" This\n          was an unbecoming thing to say, and it was said simply because he\n          wanted to be known as a rough fellow. It was rather low, and it can be\n          seen that he was still rather immature. It is because a samurai has\n          correct manners that he is admired. Speaking of other people in this\n          way is no different from an exchange between low class spearmen. It is\n          vulgar.  It is not good to settle into a set of opinions. It is a mistake to\n          put forth effort and obtain some understanding and then stop at that.\n          At first putting forth great effort to be sure that you have grasped\n          the basics, then practicing so that they may come to fruition is\n          something that will never stop for your whole lifetime. Do not rely on\n          following the degree of understanding that you have discovered, but\n          simply think, \"This is not enough.\" One should search throughout his whole life how best to follow the\n          Way. And he should study, setting his mind to work without putting\n          things off. Within this is the Way.  These are from the recorded sayings of the late Yamamoto Jin'emon: If you can understand one affair, you will understand eight. An affected laugh shows lack of self-respect in a man and lewdness in\n          a woman. Whether speaking formally or informally, one should look his listener\n          in the eye. A polite greeting is done at the beginning and finished.\n          Speaking with downcast eyes is carelessness. It is carelessness to go about with one's hands inside the slits in\n          the sides of his hakama. After reading books and the like, it is best to burn them or throw\n          them away. It is said that reading books is the work of the Imperial\n          Court, but the work of the House of Nakano is found in military valor,\n          grasping the staff of oak. A samurai with no group and no horse is not a samurai at all. A kusemono is a man to rely upon. It is said that one should rise at four in the morning, bathe and\n          arrange his hair daily, eat when the sun comes up, and retire when it\n          becomes dark. A samurai will use a toothpick even though he has not eaten. Inside\n          the skin of a dog, outside the hide of a tiger.  How should a person respond when he is asked, \"As a human being, what\n          is essential in terms of purpose and discipline?\" First, let us say,\n          \"It is to become of the mind that is right now pure and lacking\n          complications.\" People in general all seem to be dejected. When one\n          has a pure and uncomplicated mind, his expression will be lively. When\n          one is attending to matters, there is one thing that comes forth from\n          his heart. That is, in terms of one's lord, loyalty; in terms of one's\n          parents, filial piety; in martial affairs, bravery; and apart from\n          that, something that can be used by all the world. This is very difficult to discover. Once discovered, it is again\n          difficult to keep in constant effect. There is nothing outside the\n          thought of the immediate moment.  Every morning, the samurai of fifty or sixty years ago would bathe,\n          shave their foreheads, put lotion in their hair, cut their fingernails\n          and toenails, rubbing them with pumice and then with wood sorrel, and,\n          without fail, pay attention to their personal appearance. It goes\n          without saying that their armor in general was kept free from rust,\n          that it was dusted, shined, and arranged. Although it seems that taking special care of one's appearance is\n          similar to showiness, it is nothing akin to elegance. Even if you are\n          aware that you may be struck down today and are firmly resolved to an\n          inevitable death, if you are slain with an unseemly appearance, you\n          will show your lack of previous resolve, will be despised by your\n          enemy, and will appear unclean. For this reason it is said that both\n          old and young should take care of their appearance. Although you say that this is troublesome and time-consuming, a\n          samurai's work is in such things. It is neither busy-work nor\n          time-consuming. In constantly hardening one's resolution to die in\n          battle, deliberately becoming as one already dead, and working at\n          one's job and dealing with military affairs, there should be no shame.\n          But when the time comes, a person will be shamed if he is not\n          conscious of these things even in his dreams, and rather passes his\n          days in self-interest and self-indulgence. And if he thinks that this\n          is not shameful, and feels that nothing else matters as long as he is\n          comfortable, then his dissipate and discourteous actions will be\n          repeatedly regrettable. The person without previous resolution to inevitable death makes\n          certain that his death will be in bad form. But if one is resolved to\n          death beforehand, in what way can he be despicable? One should be\n          especially diligent in this concern. Furthermore, during the last thirty years customs have changed; now\n          when young samurai get together, if there is not just talk about money\n          matters, loss and gain, secrets, clothing styles, or matters of sex,\n          there is no reason to gather together at all. Customs are going to\n          pieces. One can say that formerly, when a man reached the age of\n          twenty or thirty, he did not carry despicable things in his heart, and\n          thus neither did such words appear. If an elder unwittingly said\n          something of that sort, he thought of it as a sort of injury. This new\n          custom probably appears because people attach importance to being\n          beautiful before society and to household finances. What things a\n          person should be able to accomplish if he had no haughtiness\n          concerning his place in society! It is a wretched thing that the young men of today are so contriving\n          and so proud of their material possessions. Men with contriving hearts\n          are lacking in duty. Lacking in duty, they will have no self-respect.  According to Master Ittei, even a poor penman will become substantial\n          in the art of calligraphy if he studies by imitating a good model and\n          puts forth effort. A retainer should be able to become substantial,\n          too, if he takes a good retainer as his model. Today, however, there are no models of good retainers. In light of\n          this, it would be good to make a model and to learn from that.\n          To do this, one should look at many people and choose from each person\n          his best point only. For example, one person for politeness, one for\n          bravery, one for the proper way of speaking, one for correct conduct,\n          and one for steadiness of mind. Thus will the model be made. An apprentice will not be up to his teacher's good points in the world\n          of the arts either but will receive and imitate only his bad ones.\n          This is worthless. There are people who are good at manners but have\n          no uprightness. In imitating someone like this, one is likely to\n          ignore the politeness and imitate only the lack of uprightness. If one\n          perceives a person's good points, he will have a model teacher for\n          anything.  When delivering something like an important letter or other written\n          materials, grasp it firmly in your hand as you go and do not release\n          it once, but hand it over directly to the recipient.  A retainer is a man who remains consistently undistracted twenty-four\n          hours a day, whether he is in the presence of his master or in public.\n          If one is careless during his rest period, the public will see him as\n          being only careless.  Regardless of class, a person who does something beyond his social\n          standing will at some point commit mean or cowardly acts. In the lower\n          classes there are even people who will run away. One should be careful\n          with menials and the like.  There are many people who, by being attached to a martial art and\n          taking apprentices, believe that they have arrived at the full stature\n          of a warrior. But it is a regrettable thing to put forth much effort\n          and in the end become an \"artist.\" In artistic technique it is good to\n          learn to the extent that you will not be lacking. In general, a person\n          who is versatile in many things is considered to be vulgar and to have\n          only a broad knowledge of matters of importance.  When something is said to you by the master, whether it is for your\n          good or bad fortune, to withdraw in silence shows perplexity. You\n          should have some appropriate response. It is important to have\n          resolution beforehand. Moreover, if at the time that you are asked to perform some function\n          you have deep happiness or great pride, it will show exactly as that\n          on your face. This has been seen in many people and is rather\n          unbecoming. But another type of person knows his own defects and\n          thinks, \"I'm a clumsy person but I've been asked to do this thing\n          anyway. Now how am I going to go about it? I can see that this is\n          going to be much trouble and cause for concern.\" Though these words\n          are never said, they will appear on the surface. This shows modesty. By inconsistency and frivolity we stray from the Way and show\n          ourselves to be beginners, in this we do much harm.  Learning is a good thing, but more often it leads to mistakes. It is\n          like the admonition of the priest K\u014dnan. It is worthwhile just looking\n          at the deeds of accomplished persons for the purpose of knowing our\n          own insufficiencies. But often this does not happen. For the most\n          part, we admire our own opinions and become fond of arguing.  Last year at a great conference there was a certain man who explained\n          his dissenting opinion and said that he was resolved to kill the\n          conference leader if it was not accepted. His motion was passed. After\n          the procedures were over the man said, \"Their assent came quickly. I\n          think that they are too weak and unreliable to be counselors to the\n          master.\"  When an official place is extremely busy and someone comes in\n          thoughtlessly with some business or other, often there are people who\n          will treat him coldly and become angry. This is not good at all. At\n          such times, the etiquette of a samurai is to calm himself and deal\n          with the person in a good manner. To treat a person harshly is the way\n          of middle-class lackeys.  According to the situation, there are times when you must rely on a\n          person for something or other. If this is done repeatedly, it becomes\n          a matter of importuning that person and can be rather rude. If there\n          is something that must be done, it is better not to rely on others.  There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a\n          sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road.\n          But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still\n          get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be\n          perplexed, though you still get the same soaking. This understanding\n          extends to everything.  In China there was once a man who liked pictures of dragons, and his\n          clothing and furnishings were all designed accordingly. His deep\n          affection for dragons was brought to the attention of the dragon god,\n          and one day a real dragon appeared before his window. It is said that\n          he died of fright. He was probably a man who always spoke big words\n          but acted differently when facing the real thing.  There was a certain person who was a master of the spear. When he was\n          dying, he called his best disciple and spoke his last injunctions: I have passed on to you all the secret techniques of this school, and\n          there is nothing left to say. If you think of taking on a disciple\n          yourself, then you should practice diligently with the bamboo sword\n          every day. Superiority is not just a matter of secret techniques. Also, in the instructions of a renga teacher, it was said that\n          the day before the poetry meeting one should calm his mind and look at\n          a collection of poems. This is concentration on one affair. All\n          professions should be done with concentration.  Although the Mean is the standard for all things, in military affairs\n          a man must always strive to outstrip others. According to archery\n          instructions the right and left hands are supposed to be level, but\n          the right hand has a tendency to go higher. They will become level if\n          one will lower the right hand a bit when shooting. In the stories of\n          the elder warriors it is said that on the battlefield if one wills\n          himself to outstrip warriors of accomplishment, and day and night\n          hopes to strike down a powerful enemy, he will grow indefatigable and\n          fierce of heart and will manifest courage. One should use this\n          principle in everyday affairs, too.  There is a way of bringing up the child of a samurai. From the time of\n          infancy one should encourage bravery and avoid trivially frightening\n          or teasing the child. If a person is affected by cowardice as a child,\n          it remains a lifetime scar. It is a mistake for parents to\n          thoughtlessly make their children dread lightning, or to have them not\n          go into dark places, or to tell them frightening things in order to\n          stop them from crying. Furthermore, a child will become timid if he is scolded severely. One should not allow bad habits to form. After a bad habit is\n          ingrained, although you admonish the child, he will not improve. As\n          for such things as proper speaking and good manners, gradually make\n          the child aware of them. Let him not know avarice. Other than that, if\n          he is of a normal nature, he should develop well by the way he is\n          brought up. Moreover, the child of parents who have a bad relationship will be\n          unfilial. This is natural. Even the birds and beasts are affected by\n          what they are used to seeing and hearing from the time they are born.\n          Also, the relationship between father and child may deteriorate\n          because of a mother's foolishness. A mother loves her child above all\n          things, and will be partial to the child that is corrected by his\n          father. If she becomes the child's ally, there will be discord between\n          father and son. Because of the shallowness of her mind, a woman sees\n          the child as her support in old age.  You will be tripped up by people when your resolution is lax.\n          Moreover, if at a meeting you are distracted while another person is\n          speaking, by your carelessness you may think that he is of your\n          opinion and you will follow along saying, \"Of course, of course,\" even\n          though he is saying something that is contrary to your own feelings,\n          and others will think that you are in agreement with him. Because of\n          this, you should never be distracted even for an instant when meeting\n          with others. When you are listening to a story or being spoken to, you should be\n          mindful not to be tripped up; and if there is something that you do\n          not agree with, to speak your mind, to show your opponent his error,\n          and to grapple with the situation. Even in unimportant affairs\n          mistakes come from little things. One should be mindful of this.\n          Moreover, it is better not to become acquainted with men about whom\n          you have formerly had some doubts. No matter what you do, they will be\n          people by whom you will be tripped up or taken in. To be certain of\n          this fact you must have much experience.  The saying \"The arts aid the body\" is for samurai of other regions.\n          For samurai of the Nabeshima clan the arts bring ruin to the body. In\n          all cases, the person who practices an art is an artist, not a\n          samurai, and one should have the intention of being called a samurai. When one has the conviction that even the slightest artful ability is\n          harmful to the samurai, all the arts become useful to him. One should\n          understand this sort of thing.  Ordinarily, looking into the mirror and grooming oneself is sufficient\n          for the upkeep of one's personal appearance. This is very important.\n          Most people's personal appearance is poor because they do not look\n          into the mirror well enough. Training to speak properly can be done by correcting one's speech when\n          at home. Practice in letter writing goes to the extent of taking care in even\n          one-line letters. It is good if all the above contain a quiet strength. Moreover,\n          according to what the priest Ry\u014dzan heard when he was in the Kamigata\n          area, when one is writing a letter, he should think that the recipient\n          will make it into a hanging scroll.  It is said that one should not hesitate to correct himself when he has\n          made a mistake. If he corrects himself without the least bit of delay,\n          his mistakes will quickly disappear. But when he tries to cover up a\n          mistake, it will become all the more unbecoming and painful. When\n          words that one should not use slip out, if one will speak his mind\n          quickly and clearly, those words will have no effect and he will not\n          be obstructed by worry. If there is, however, someone who blames a\n          person for such a thing, one should be prepared to say something like,\n          \"I have explained the reason for my careless speech. There is nothing\n          else to be done if you will not listen to reason. Since I said it\n          unwittingly, it should be the same as if you didn't hear it. No one\n          can evade blame.\" And one should never talk about people or secret\n          matters. Furthermore, one should only speak according to how he judges\n          his listener's feelings.  The proper manner of calligraphy is nothing other than not being\n          careless, but in this way one's writing will simply be sluggish and\n          stiff. One should go beyond this and depart from the norm. This\n          principle applies to all things.  It is said, \"When you would see into a person's heart, become ill.\"\n          When you are sick or in difficulties, many of those who were friendly\n          or close to you in daily life will become cowards. Whenever anyone is\n          in unhappy circumstances, you should above all inquire after them by\n          visiting or sending some gift. And you should never in your whole life\n          be negligent toward someone from whom you have received a favor. By such things the consideration of others can be seen. In this world\n          the people who will rely on others when they are in difficulties and\n          afterwards not give them a thought are many.  You cannot tell whether a person is good or bad by his vicissitudes in\n          life. Good and bad fortune are matters of fate. Good and bad actions\n          are Man's Way. Retribution of good and evil is taught simply as a\n          moral lesson.  Because of some business, Morooka Hikoemon was called upon to swear\n          before the gods concerning the truth of a certain matter. But he said,\n          \"A samurai's word is harder than metal. Since I have impressed this\n          fact upon myself, what more can the gods and Buddhas do?\" and the\n          swearing was cancelled. This happened when he was twenty-six.  Master Ittei said, \"Whatever one prays for will be granted. Long ago\n          there were no matsutake mushrooms in our province. Some men who\n          saw them in the Kamigata area prayed that they might grow here, and\n          nowadays they are growing all over Kitayama. In the future I would\n          like to have Japanese cypress grow in our province. As this is\n          something that everyone desires, I predict it for the future. This\n          being so, everyone should pray for it.\"  When something out of the ordinary happens, it is ridiculous to say\n          that it is a mystery or a portent of something to come. Eclipses of\n          the sun and moon, comets, clouds that flutter like flags, snow in the\n          fifth month, lightning in the twelfth month, and so on, are all things\n          that occur every fifty or one hundred years. They occur according to\n          the evolution of Yin and Yang. The fact that the sun rises in the east\n          and sets in the west would be a mystery, too, if it were not an\n          everyday occurrence. It is not dissimilar. Furthermore, the fact that\n          something bad always happens in the world when strange phenomena occur\n          is due to people seeing something like fluttering clouds and thinking\n          that something is going to happen. The mystery is created in their\n          minds, and by waiting for the disaster, it is from their very minds\n          that it occurs. The occurrence of mysteries is always by word of mouth.  Calculating people are contemptible. The reason for this is that\n          calculation deals with loss and gain, and the loss and gain mind never\n          stops. Death is considered loss and life is considered gain. Thus,\n          death is something that such a person does not care for, and he is\n          contemptible. Furthermore, scholars and their like are men who with wit and speech\n          hide their own true cowardice and greed. People often misjudge this.  Lord Naoshige said, \"The Way of the Samurai is in desperateness. Ten\n          men or more cannot kill such a man. Common sense will not accomplish\n          great things. Simply become insane and desperate. \"In the Way of the Samurai, if one uses discrimination, he will fall\n          behind. One needs neither loyalty nor devotion, but simply to become\n          desperate in the Way. Loyalty and devotion are of themselves within\n          desperation.\"  The saying of Shida Kichinosuke, \"When there is a choice of either\n          living or dying, as long as there remains nothing behind to blemish\n          one's reputation, it is better to live,\" is a paradox. He also said,\n          \"When there is a choice of either going or not going, it is better not\n          to go.\" A corollary to this would be, \"When there is a choice of\n          either eating or not eating, it is better not to eat. When there is a\n          choice of either dying or not dying, it is better to die.\"  When meeting calamities or difficult situations, it is not enough to\n          simply say that one is not at all flustered. When meeting difficult\n          situations, one should dash forward bravely and with joy. It is the\n          crossing of a single barrier and is like the saying \"The more water,\n          the higher the boat.\"  It is spiritless to think that you cannot attain to that which you\n          have seen and heard the masters attain. The masters are men. You are\n          also a man. If you think that you will be inferior in doing something,\n          you will be on that road very soon. Master Ittei said, \"Confucius was a sage because he had the will to\n          become a scholar when he was fifteen years old. He was not a sage\n          because he studied later on.\" This is the same as the Buddhist maxim,\n          \"first intention, then enlightenment.\"  A warrior should be careful in all things and should dislike to be the\n          least bit worsted. Above all, if he is not careful in his choice of\n          words he may say things like, \"I'm a coward,\" or \"At that time I'd\n          probably run,\" or \"How frightening,\" or \"How painful.\" These are words\n          that should not be said even in jest, on a whim, or when talking in\n          one's sleep. If a person with understanding hears such things, he will\n          see to the bottom of the speaker's heart. This is something that\n          should be carefully thought about beforehand.  When one's own attitude on courage is fixed in his heart, and when his\n          resolution is devoid of doubt, then when the time comes he will of\n          necessity be able to choose the right move. This will be manifested by\n          one's conduct and speech according to the occasion. One's word is\n          especially important. It is not for exposing the depths of one's\n          heart. This is something that people will know by one's everyday\n          affairs.  After I took up the attitude of a retainer, I never sat sloppily\n          whether at home or in some other place. Neither did I speak, but if\n          there was something that could not be done properly without words, I\n          made an effort to settle things by putting ten words into one.\n          Yamazaki Kurando was like this.  It is said that even after one's head has been cut off, he can still\n          perform some function. This fact can be known from the examples of\n          Nitta Yoshisada and \u014cno D\u014dken. How shall one man be inferior to\n          another? Mitani Joky\u016b said, \"Even if a man be sick to death, he can\n          bear up for two or three days.\"  In the words of the ancients, one should make his decisions within the\n          space of seven breaths. Lord Takanobu said, \"If discrimination is\n          long, it will spoil.\" Lord Naoshige said, \"When matters are done\n          leisurely, seven out of ten will turn out badly. A warrior is a person\n          who does things quickly.\" When your mind is going hither and thither, discrimination will never\n          be brought to a conclusion. With an intense, fresh, and undelaying\n          spirit, one will make his judgments within the space of seven breaths.\n          It is a matter of being determined and having the spirit to break\n          right through to the other side.  In admonishing the master, if one is not of the proper rank to do so,\n          it shows great loyalty to have someone who is of that rank speak and\n          have the master correct his mistakes. To be on a footing to do this\n          one must be on cordial terms with everyone. If one does this for his\n          own sake, it is simply flattery. One does this, rather, in his concern\n          to support the clan on his own. If one will do it, it can be done.  Bad relations between retired and present rulers, father and son, and\n          elder and younger brothers develop from selfish motives. The proof of\n          this is that there are no such bad relations between master and\n          retainer.  It is unthinkable to be disturbed at something like being ordered to\n          become a r\u014dnin. People at the time of Lord Katsushige used to say, \"If\n          one has not been a r\u014dnin at least seven times, he will not be a true\n          retainer. Seven times down, eight times up.\" Men like Narutomi Hy\u014dgo have been r\u014dnin seven times. One should\n          understand that it is something like being a self-righting doll. The\n          master is also apt to give such orders as a test.  Illnesses and the like become serious because of one's feelings. I was\n          born when my father was seventy-one years old and was hence a rather\n          sickly child. But because I have had the great desire to be of use\n          even in old age, when the chance came, I improved my health and\n          haven't been sick since. And I have abstained from sex and have\n          consistently taken moxa cautery. There are things that I feel have\n          definitely had effect. There is a saying that even though one burns up a\n          mamushi seven times, it will return each time to its original\n          form. This is my great hope. I have always been obsessed with one\n          idea: to be able to realize my heart's desire, which is that, though I\n          am born seven times, each time I will be reborn as a retainer of my\n          clan.  Yamamoto Jin'emon once said that it is best for a samurai to have good\n          retainers. Military affairs are not matters for one person alone,\n          regardless of how useful he tries to be. Money is something that one\n          can borrow from people, but a good man cannot suddenly be come by. One\n          should sustain a man kindly and well from the first. And in having\n          retainers it will not do to nourish oneself alone. If you divide what\n          you have and feed your lower ranks, you will be able to hold good men.  A person with a bit of wisdom is one who will criticize the times.\n          This is the basis of disaster. A person who is discreet in speaking\n          will be useful during the good times and will avoid punishment during\n          the bad.  Being superior to others is nothing other than having people talk\n          about your affairs and listening to their opinions. The general run of\n          people settle for their own opinions and thus never excel. Having a\n          discussion with a person is one step in excelling him. A certain\n          person discussed with me the written materials at the clan office. He\n          is better than someone like me in writing and researching. In seeking\n          correction from others, you excel them.  It is bad when one thing becomes two. One should not look for anything\n          else in the Way of the Samurai. It is the same for anything that is\n          called a Way. Therefore, it is inconsistent to hear something of the\n          Way of Confucius or the Way of the Buddha, and say that this is the\n          Way of the Samurai. If one understands things in this manner, he\n          should be able to hear about all Ways and be more and more in accord\n          with his own.  For a samurai, a single word is important no matter where he may be.\n          By just one single word martial valor can be made apparent. In\n          peaceful times words show one's bravery. In troubled times, too, one\n          knows that by a single word his strength or cowardice can be seen.\n          This single word is the flower of one\u2019s heart. It is not something\n          said simply with one\u2019s mouth.  A warrior should not say something fainthearted even casually. He\n          should set his mind to this beforehand. Even in trifling matters the\n          depths of one\u2019s heart can be seen.  No matter what it is, there is nothing that cannot be done. If one\n          manifests the determination, he can move heaven and earth as he\n          pleases. But because man is pluckless, he cannot set his mind to it.\n          Moving heaven and earth without putting forth effort is simply a\n          matter of concentration.  A person who is said to be proficient at the arts is like a fool.\n          Because of his foolishness in concerning himself with just one thing,\n          he thinks of nothing else and thus becomes proficient. He is a\n          worthless person.  Until the age of forty it is best to gather strength. It is\n          appropriate to have settled down by the age of fifty.  When discussing things with someone, it is best to speak appropriately\n          about whatever the subject may be. No matter how good what you are\n          saying might be, it will dampen the conversation if it is irrelevant.  When someone is giving you his opinion, you should receive it with\n          deep gratitude even though it is worthless. If you don\u2019t, he will not\n          tell you the things that he has seen and heard about you again. It is\n          best to both give and receive opinions in a friendly way.  There is a saying that great genius matures late. If something is not\n          brought to fruition over a period of twenty to thirty years, it will\n          not be of great merit. When a retainer is of a mind to do his work\n          hurriedly, he will intrude upon the work of others and will be said to\n          be young but able. He will become over-enthusiastic and will be\n          considered rather rude. He will put on the airs of someone who has\n          done great works, will become a flatterer and insincere, and will be\n          talked about behind his back. In the pursuit of one\u2019s development, if\n          he does not make great effort and is not supported by others in his\n          advancement in the world, he will be of no use.  When one is involved in the affairs of a warrior, such as being a\n          kaishaku or making an arrest within one\u2019s own clan or group,\n          people will notice when the time comes if he has resolved beforehand\n          that no one can take his place. One should always take the attitude of\n          standing above others in martial valor, always feel that he is\n          inferior to no one, and always cultivate his courage.  When on the battlefield, if you try not to let others take the lead\n          and have the sole intention of breaking into the enemy lines, then you\n          will not fall behind others, your mind will become fierce, and you\n          will manifest martial valor. This fact has been passed down by the\n          elders. Furthermore, if you are slain in battle, you should be\n          resolved to have your corpse facing the enemy.  If everyone were in accord and left things to Providence, their hearts\n          would be at ease. If they are not in accord, though they would do acts\n          of righteousness, they lack loyalty. To be at odds with one\u2019s\n          companions, to be prone to miss even infrequent meetings, to speak\n          only cantankerous words\u2014all come from a shallow foolishness of mind.\n          But thinking of the moment of truth, even though it be unpleasant, one\n          should fix it in his mind to meet people cordially at all times and\n          without distraction, and in a way in which one will not seem bored.\n          Moreover, in this world of uncertainties one is not even sure of the\n          present. It would be worthless to die while being thought ill of by\n          people. Lies and insincerity are unbecoming. This is because they are\n          for self-profit. Though it is not profitable to have others lead the way, or not to be\n          quarrelsome, or not to be lacking in manners, or to be humble, if one\n          will do things for the benefit of others and meet even those whom he\n          has met often before in a first-time manner, he will have no bad\n          relationships. Manners between husband and wife are not different from\n          this. If one is as discreet in the end as he is in the beginning,\n          there should be no discord.  There is a certain priest who is said to be able to get everything\n          accomplished by means of his cleverness. There is not a monk in Japan\n          today who can oppose him. This is not the least bit strange. There is\n          simply no one who sees through to the foundation of things.  Senility is when one goes about doing only that towards which he is\n          most inclined. One is able to suppress and hide this while his vigor\n          is still strong, but when he weakens, the essential strong points of\n          his nature appear and are a shame to him. This manifests itself in\n          several forms, but there is not a man who does not get senile by the\n          time he reaches sixty. And when one thinks that he will not be senile,\n          he is already so. It can be thought that Master Ittei had a senility of argumentation.\n          As if to show that he alone could support the House of Nabeshima, he\n          went about with a senile appearance to prominent people\u2019s houses and\n          chatted amiably with them. At the time, everybody thought that it was\n          reasonable, but thinking about it now, it was senility. For myself,\n          with that good example and the feeling that dotage was overtaking me,\n          I declined to participate at the temple on the thirteenth anniversary\n          of Lord Mitsushige\u2019s death, and I have decided to stay more and more\n          indoors. One must get a clear view of what lies ahead.  If one is but secure at the foundation, he will not be pained by\n          departure from minor details or affairs that are contrary to\n          expectation. But in the end, the details of a matter are important.\n          The right and wrong of one\u2019s way of doing things are found in trivial\n          matters.  According to a story at the Ry\u016btaiji, there was a master of the\n          Book of Changes in the Kamigata area who said that even if a\n          man is a priest, it is useless to give him rank while he is under the\n          age of forty. This is because he will make many mistakes. Confucius\n          was not the only man to become unperplexed after reaching the age of\n          forty. Upon reaching the age of forty, both wise and foolish have gone\n          through an appropriate amount of experience and will no longer be\n          perplexed.  Concerning martial valor, merit lies more in dying for one\u2019s master\n          than in striking down the enemy. This can be understood from the\n          devotion of Sato Tsugunobu.  When I was young, I kept a \u201cDiary of Regret\u201d and tried to record my\n          mistakes day by day, but there was never a day when I didn\u2019t have\n          twenty or thirty entries. As there was no end to it, I gave up. Even\n          today, when I think about the day\u2019s affairs after going to bed, there\n          is never a day when I do not make some blunder in speaking or in some\n          activity. Living without mistakes is truly impossible. But this is\n          something that people who live by cleverness have no inclination to\n          think about.  When reading something aloud, it is best to read from the belly.\n          Reading from one\u2019s mouth, one\u2019s voice will not endure. This is Nakano\n          Shikibu\u2019s teaching.  During happy times, pride and extravagance are dangerous. If one is\n          not prudent in ordinary times, he will not be able to catch up. A\n          person who advances during good times will falter during the bad.  Master Ittei said, \u201cIn calligraphy it is progress when the paper,\n          brush and ink are in harmony.\u201d Yet they are so wont to be disjointed!  The master took a book from its box. When he opened it there was the\n          smell of drying clovebuds.  What is called generosity is really compassion. In the\n          Shin\u2019ei it is written, \u201cSeen from the eye of compassion, there\n          is no one to be disliked. One who has sinned is to be pitied all the\n          more.\u201d There is no limit to the breadth and depth of one\u2019s heart.\n          There is room enough for all. That we still worship the sages of the\n          three ancient kingdoms is because their compassion reaches us yet\n          today. Whatever you do should be done for the sake of your master and\n          parents, the people in general, and for posterity. This is great\n          compassion. The wisdom and courage that come from compassion are real\n          wisdom and courage. When one punishes or strives with the heart of\n          compassion, what he does will be limitless in strength and\n          correctness. Doing something for one\u2019s own sake is shallow and mean\n          and turns into evil. I understood the matters of wisdom and courage\n          some time ago. I am just now beginning to understand the matter of\n          compassion. Lord Ieyasu said, \u201cThe foundation for ruling the country in peace is\n          compassion, for when one thinks of the people as being his children,\n          the people will think of him as their parent.\u201d Moreover, can\u2019t it be\n          thought that the names \u201cgroup parent\u201d and \u201cgroup child\u201d [i.e., group\n          leader and member] are so called because they are attached to each\n          other by the harmonious hearts of a parent-child relationship? One can understand that Lord Naoshige\u2019s phrase \u201cA fault-finder will\n          come to be punished by others\u201d came from his compassion. His saying\n          \u201cPrinciple is beyond reason\u201d should also be considered compassion. He\n          enthusiastically stated that we should taste the inexhaustible.  The priest Tannen said, \u201cA clever retainer will not advance. However,\n          there are no cases of stupid people coming up in the world either.\u201d  This was Nakano Shikibu\u2019s opinion. When one is young, he can often bring on shame for a lifetime by\n          homosexual acts. To have no understanding of this is dangerous. As\n          there is no one to inform young men of this matter, I can give its\n          general outline. One should understand that a woman is faithful to only one husband.\n          Our feelings go to one person for one lifetime. If this is not so, it\n          is the same as sodomy or prostitution. This is shame for a warrior.\n          Ihara Saikaku has written a famous line that goes, \u201cAn adolescent\n          without an older lover is the same as a woman with no husband.\u201d But\n          this sort of person is ridiculous. A young man should test an older man for at least five years, and if\n          he is assured of that person\u2019s intentions, then he too should request\n          the relationship. A fickle person will not enter deeply into a\n          relationship and later will abandon his lover. If they can assist and devote their lives to each other, then their\n          nature can be ascertained. But if one partner is crooked, the other\n          should say that there are hindrances to the relationship and sever it\n          with firmness. If the first should ask what those hindrances are, then\n          one should respond that he will never in his life say. If he should\n          continue to push the matter, one should get angry; if he continues to\n          push even further, cut him down. Furthermore, the older man should ascertain the younger\u2019s real motives\n          in the aforementioned way. If the younger man can devote himself and\n          get into the situation for five or six years, then it will not be\n          unsuitable. Above all, one should not divide one\u2019s way into two. One should strive\n          in the Way of the Samurai.  Hoshino Ry\u014dtetsu was the progenitor of homosexuality in our province,\n          and although it can be said that his disciples were many, he\n          instructed each one individually. Edayoshi Sabur\u014dzaemon was a man who\n          understood the foundation of homosexuality. Once, when accompanying\n          his master to Edo, Ry\u014dtetsu asked Sabur\u014dzaemon, \u201cWhat have you\n          understood of homosexuality?\u201d Sabur\u014dzaemon replied, \u201cIt is something both pleasant and unpleasant.\u201d Ry\u014dtetsu was pleased and said, \u201cYou have taken great pains for some\n          time to be able to say such a thing.\u201d Some years later there was a person who asked Sabur\u014dzaemon the meaning\n          of the above. He replied, \u201cTo lay down one\u2019s life for another is the\n          basic principle of homosexuality. If it is not so, it becomes a matter\n          of shame. However, then you have nothing left to lay down for your\n          master. It is therefore understood to be something both pleasant and\n          unpleasant.\u201d  Master Ittei said, \u201cIf one were to say what it is to do good, in a\n          single word it would be to endure suffering. Not enduring is bad\n          without exception.\u201d  Until one reaches the age of forty it is better to put off wisdom and\n          discrimination and excel in vitality. According to the person and the\n          rank, though a person has passed the age of forty, if he has no\n          vitality, he will get no response from others.  Recently, a certain person on his way to Edo sent home a detailed\n          letter from the first night\u2019s inn. Though he was a person who\n          neglected such things when he was busy, he excelled other people in\n          being as attentive as this.  In the judgment of the elders, a samurai\u2019s obstinacy should be\n          excessive. A thing done with moderation may later be judged to be\n          insufficient. I have heard that when one thinks he has gone too far,\n          he will not have erred. This sort of rule should not be forgotten.  When one has made a decision to kill a person, even if it will be very\n          difficult to succeed by advancing straight ahead, it will not do to\n          think about going at it in a long roundabout way. One\u2019s heart may\n          slacken, he may miss his chance, and by and large there will be no\n          success. The Way of the Samurai is one of immediacy, and it is best to\n          dash in headlong. When a certain man was going to the sutra readings at the Jiss\u014din in\n          Kawakami, one of his pages got drunk on the ferry-boat and began to\n          pester one of the sailors. When they landed on the other side, as the\n          page had drawn his sword, the sailor took a pole and struck him on the\n          head. At that time the other sailors all ran up together carrying oars\n          and were at the point of striking the page down. However, as the\n          master passed by with an air of not knowing what was happening, one of\n          the other pages ran back and apologized to the sailors. Then,\n          pacifying his comrade, he accompanied him home. That night the page\n          who had been drunk learned that his sword was being taken away from\n          him. Now, first of all, it was an insufficiency on the master\u2019s part not to\n          have reproved and pacified the drunken page while they were on the\n          boat. Furthermore, even though his page had acted unreasonably, after\n          he had been struck on the head there was no reason for an apology. The\n          master should have approached the sailor and the drunken page in an\n          apologetic manner and cut them both down. Certainly he was a\n          spiritless master.  The resolution of the men of former times was deep. Those between the\n          ages of thirteen and sixty went to the front lines. For this reason\n          men of advanced years hid their age.  For serious affairs that bear directly on oneself, if one does not\n          take care of things by making his own judgment his foundation and\n          breaking through headlong, matters will not be brought to a close. In\n          conferring with people about matters of importance, there may be many\n          cases when your affair is thought lightly of, or when people will not\n          speak of the real circumstances. At such times one must use his own\n          judgment. At any rate, it is sufficient to become a fanatic and choose\n          to throw away one\u2019s life. At such a time, if one thinks about doing\n          things well, confusion will soon arise and he will blunder. In many\n          cases one\u2019s downfall may be brought about by an ally who is trying to\n          do something for one\u2019s benefit, or one may be killed by his friend\u2019s\n          kindness. It is the same as when one requests permission to become a\n          monk.  Lord Naoshige said, \u201cAn ancestor\u2019s good or evil can be determined by\n          the conduct of his descendants.\u201d A descendant should act in a way that\n          will manifest the good in his ancestor and not the bad. This is filial\n          piety.  It is a wretched thing that one\u2019s family lineage be thrown into\n          confusion with an adoption based on money alone. Such a thing is\n          immoral from the beginning, but it is extreme wickedness to be thus\n          immoral with the excuse that without doing so one will be unable to\n          afford even today\u2019s rice.  When Nakano Sh\u014dgen committed seppuku, the members of his group\n          gathered at the late \u014cki Hy\u014dbu\u2019s place and said various bad things\n          about him. Hy\u014dbu said, \u201cOne does not speak bad things about a person\n          after his death. And especially since a person who has received some\n          censure is to be pitied, it is the obligation of a samurai to speak\n          something good of him, no matter how little. There is no doubt that in\n          twenty years Sh\u014dgen will have the reputation of a faithful retainer.\u201d\n          These were truly the words of a seasoned man.  To place one\u2019s armor out splendidly is a fine discipline, but it is\n          sufficient if it is simply all accounted for. Fukabori Inosuke\u2019s armor\n          is a good example. Men of high rank and with many retainers will also\n          need such things as money to set aside for campaign use. It is said\n          that Okabe Kunai made bags equalling the number of men in his group,\n          affixed a name to each, and put in the appropriate amount of money for\n          a campaign. This sort of discipline is profound. As for men of low\n          rank, if they cannot make the proper preparation at the time, they\n          should rely on assistance from their group leader. To this extent, it\n          is necessary for the group leader to be on intimate terms with his men\n          beforehand. As for men who are under the master\u2019s direction, and especially for\n          those who are with him directly, it is better to be without\n          preparation money. At the time of the summer maneuvers at Osaka, a\n          certain person brought along twelve monme of refined silver and\n          went off with Master Taku Zusho. This, of course, would have been fine\n          if he had simply ridden off early. I think that it is better to\n          dispense with such care.  In carefully scrutinizing the affairs of the past, we find that there\n          are many different opinions about them, and that there are some things\n          that are quite unclear. It is better to regard such things as\n          unknowable. Lord Sanenori once said, \u201cAs for the things that we don\u2019t\n          understand, there\n          are ways of understanding them. Furthermore, there are some\n          things we understand just naturally, and again some that we can\u2019t\n          understand no matter how hard we try. This is interesting.\u201d This is very profound. It is natural that one cannot understand deep\n          and hidden things. Those things that are easily understood are rather\n          shallow. It is said that much sake, self-pride, and luxury are to be avoided by\n          a samurai. There is no cause for anxiety when you are unhappy, but\n          when you become a little elated, these three things become dangerous.\n          Look at the human condition. It is unseemly for a person to become\n          prideful and extravagant when things are going well. Therefore, it is\n          better to have some unhappiness while one is still young, for if a\n          person does not experience some bitterness, his disposition will not\n          settle down. A person who becomes fatigued when unhappy is useless.  Meeting with people should be a matter of quickly grasping their\n          temperament and reacting appropriately to this person and that.\n          Especially with an extremely argumentative person, after yielding\n          considerably one should argue him down with superior logic, but\n          without sounding harsh, and in a fashion that will allow no resentment\n          to be left afterwards. This is a function of both the heart and words.\n          This was an opinion given by a priest concerning personal encounters.  Dreams are truthful manifestations. When I occasionally have dreams of\n          dying in battle or committing seppuku, if I brace myself with courage,\n          my frame of mind within the dream gradually changes. This concerns the dream I had on the night of the twenty-seventh day\n          of the fifth month.  If one were to say in a word what the condition of being a samurai is,\n          its basis lies first in seriously devoting one\u2019s body and soul to his\n          master. And if one is asked what to do beyond this, it would be to fit\n          oneself inwardly with intelligence, humanity, and courage. The\n          combining of these three virtues may seem unobtainable to the ordinary\n          person, but it is easy. Intelligence is nothing more than discussing\n          things with others. Limitless wisdom comes from this. Humanity is\n          something done for the sake of others, simply comparing oneself with\n          them and putting them in the fore. Courage is gritting one\u2019s teeth; it\n          is simply doing that and pushing ahead, paying no attention to the\n          circumstances. Anything that seems above these three is not necessary\n          to be known. As for outward aspects, there are personal appearance, one\u2019s way of\n          speaking, and calligraphy. And as all of these are daily matters, they\n          improve by constant practice. Basically, one should perceive their\n          nature to be one of quiet strength. If one has accomplished all these\n          things, then he should have a knowledge of our area\u2019s history and\n          customs. After that he may study the various arts as recreation. If\n          you think it over, being a retainer is simple. And these days, if you\n          observe people who are even a bit useful, you will see that they have\n          accomplished these three outward aspects.  A certain priest said that if one thoughtlessly crosses a river of\n          unknown depths and shallows, he will die in its currents without ever\n          reaching the other side or finishing his business. This is the same as\n          when one is indiscriminately eager in being a retainer without\n          understanding the customs of the times or the likes and dislikes of\n          the master and, as a result, is of no use and brings ruin upon\n          himself. To try to enter the good graces of the master is unbecoming.\n          One should consider first stepping back and getting some understanding\n          of the depths and shallows and then work without doing anything the\n          master dislikes.  If you attach a number of bags of cloves to your body, you will not be\n          affected by inclemency or colds. Some years ago, the late Nakano\n          Kazuma returned to this province as a messenger by horse in the dead\n          of winter, and though he was an old man, he was not the least bit in\n          pain. It is said that that was because of his having used cloves.\n          Furthermore, drinking a decoction of the feces from a dappled horse is\n          the way to stop bleeding from an injury received by falling off a\n          horse.  A faultless person is one who withdraws from affairs. This must be\n          done with strength.  There is surely nothing other than the single purpose of the present\n          moment. A man\u2019s whole life is a succession of moment after moment. If\n          one fully understands the present moment, there will be nothing else\n          to do, and nothing else to pursue. Live being true to the single\n          purpose of the moment. Everyone lets the present moment slip by, then looks for it as though\n          he thought it were somewhere else. No one seems to have noticed this\n          fact. But grasping this firmly, one must pile experience upon\n          experience. And once one has come to this understanding he will be a\n          different person from that point on, though he may not always bear it\n          in mind. When one understands this settling into single-mindedness well, his\n          affairs will thin out. Loyalty is also contained within this\n          single-mindedness.  It is said that what is called \u201cthe spirit of an age\u201d is something to\n          which one cannot return. That this spirit gradually dissipates is due\n          to the world\u2019s coming to an end. In the same way, a single year does\n          not have just spring or summer. A single day, too, is the same. For this reason, although one would like to change today\u2019s world back\n          to the spirit of one hundred years or more ago, it cannot be done.\n          Thus it is important to make the best out of every generation. This is\n          the mistake of people who are attached to past generations. They have\n          no understanding of this point. On the other hand, people who only know the disposition of the present\n          day and dislike the ways of the past are too lax.  Be true to the thought of the moment and avoid distraction. Other than\n          continuing to exert yourself, enter into nothing else, but go to the\n          extent of living single thought by single thought.  The brave men of old times were for the most part rowdies. As they\n          were of the disposition to be out running amuck, their vitality was\n          strong and they were brave. When I had doubts about this and asked,\n          Tsunetomo said, \u201cIt is understandable that since their vitality was\n          strong they were generally rough and went about running amuck. These\n          days rowdiness is nonexistent because man\u2019s vitality has weakened.\n          Vitality has fallen behind, but man\u2019s character has improved. Valor is\n          yet a different thing. Although men have become gentle these days\n          because of the lack of vitality, this does not mean that they are\n          inferior in being crazy to die. That has nothing to do with vitality.\u201d  Concerning the military tactics of Lord Naoshige, Uchida Sh\u014demon said\n          that it was characteristic of his retainers to face a situation with\n          no previous knowledge of what was to happen, and for him to freely\n          bring everything to a finish by a single word. When he was at the\n          point of passing from this world, he said nothing, even when his chief\n          retainers came to see him.  Once Lord Ieyasu gained nothing in a battle, but in a later judgment\n          it was said, \u201cIeyasu is a general of great courage. Of his retainers\n          who died in battle, not one of them died with his back turned. They\n          all died facing the enemy lines.\u201d Since a warrior\u2019s daily frame of mind is manifested even after death,\n          it is something that can bring shame to him.  As Yasuda Uky\u014d said about offering up the last wine cup, only the end\n          of things is important. One\u2019s whole life should be like this. When\n          guests are leaving, the mood of being reluctant to say farewell is\n          essential. If this mood is lacking, one will appear bored and the day\n          and evening\u2019s conversation will disappear. In all dealings with people\n          it is essential to have a fresh approach. One should constantly give\n          the impression that he is doing something exceptional. It is said that\n          this is possible with but a little understanding.  Our bodies are given life from the midst of nothingness. Existing\n          where there is nothing is the meaning of the phrase \u201cForm is\n          emptiness.\u201d That all things are provided for by nothingness is the\n          meaning of the phrase \u201cEmptiness is form.\u201d One should not think that\n          these are two separate things.  Uesugi Kenshin said, \u201cI never knew about winning from beginning to\n          end, but only about not being behind in a situation.\u201d This is\n          interesting. A retainer will be dumbfounded if he is behind in a\n          situation. In each and every instance, one\u2019s function or\n          responsiveness will not be shallow if he is not behind.  One should be wary of talking on end about such subjects as learning,\n          morality, or folklore in front of elders or people of rank. It is\n          disagreeable to listen to.  In the Kamigata area they have a sort of tiered lunch box they use for\n          a single day when flower viewing. Upon returning, they throw them\n          away, trampling them underfoot. As might be expected, this is one of\n          my recollections of the capital [Kyoto]. The end is important in all\n          things.  While walking along the road together, Tsunetomo said, \u201cIs not man\n          like a well-operated puppet? It is a piece of dexterous workmanship\n          that he can run, jump, leap, and even talk though there are no strings\n          attached. Will we not be guests at next year\u2019s Bon Festival? This\n          world is vanity indeed. People always forget this.\u201d  It was once said to Gon\u2019noj\u014d that \u201cright now\u201d is \u201cat that time,\u201d and\n          \u201cat that time\u201d is \u201cright now.\u201d One will miss the occasion if he thinks\n          that these two are different. For example, if one were called before\n          the master to explain something right away, he would most likely be\n          perplexed. This is proof that he understands the two to be different.\n          If, however, a person makes \u201cright now\u201d and \u201cat that time\u201d one, though\n          he will never be an advisor to the master, still he is a\n          retainer, and in order to be able to say something clearly, whether it\n          be in front of the master, the elders, or even the shogun at Edo\n          Castle, it should be practiced beforehand in the corner of one\u2019s\n          bedroom. All things are like this. Accordingly, one should inquire into things\n          carefully. It is the same for martial training as for official\n          business. When one attempts to concentrate things in this manner,\n          won\u2019t daily negligence and today\u2019s lack of resolve be understood?  Even though one has made some blunder in governmental work, it can\n          probably be excused by pleading clumsiness or inexperience. But what\n          kind of excuse may be given for the failure of the men who were\n          involved in this recent unexpected event? Master Jin\u2019emon always used\n          to say, \u201cIt is enough if a warrior is simply a stalwart,\u201d and this is\n          just such a case. If one felt that such a failure were a mortification, it would be the\n          least he could do to cut open his stomach, rather than live on in\n          shame with a burning in his breast and the feeling that he had no\n          place to go, and, as his luck as a warrior had run out, he was no\n          longer able to function quickly and had been given a bad name. But if\n          one regretted losing his life and reasoned that he should live because\n          such a death would be useless, then for the next five, ten or twenty\n          years of his life, he would be pointed at from behind and covered with\n          shame. After his death, his corpse would be smeared with disgrace, his\n          guiltless descendants would receive his dishonor for having been born\n          in his line, his ancestors\u2019 name would be dragged down, and all the\n          members of his family would be blemished. Such circumstances are truly\n          regrettable. If one has no earnest daily intention, does not consider what it is to\n          be a warrior even in his dreams, and lives through the day idly, he\n          can be said to be worthy of punishment. Presumably it can be said that a man who has been cut down was lacking\n          in ability and had run out of luck as a warrior. The man who cut him\n          down, compelled by unavoidable circumstances and feeling that there\n          was nothing else to be done, also put his life on the line, and thus\n          there should be no evidence of cowardice. Being short-tempered is\n          inappropriate, but it cannot be said that two men who face each other\n          are cowards. In this recent event, however, the men who lived and\n          covered themselves with shame were not true warriors. One should every day think over and make an effort to implant in his\n          mind the saying \u201cAt that time is right now.\u201d It is said that it is\n          strange indeed that anyone is able to pass through life by one means\n          or another in negligence. Thus, the Way of the Samurai is, morning\n          after morning, the practice of death, considering whether it will be\n          here or be there, imagining the most sightly way of dying, and putting\n          one\u2019s mind firmly in death. Although this may be a most difficult\n          thing, if one will do it, it can be done. There is nothing that\n          one should suppose cannot be done. Moreover, the influence of words is important in military affairs. It\n          would have been best for stopping the man in this recent event, too.\n          When the situation is too much, one may either cut the man down, or,\n          if the man is escaping, yell something like, \u201cDon\u2019t run! Only cowards\n          run!\u201d and thus, according to what the situation demands, achieve one\u2019s\n          goals by the influence of words. There was a certain man who was said\n          to be good at judging men\u2019s dispositions and formerly had everyone\u2019s\n          attention, and he was able to handle such cases. This is proof that\n          \u201cright now\u201d is no different from \u201cwhen the time comes.\u201d The position\n          of\n          yokoza no yari is another example of this. It is something that\n          should be made one\u2019s aim beforehand. The things to be deeply considered beforehand are many. If there is\n          someone who has killed a man in the lord\u2019s mansion and has managed to\n          escape, as one does not know whether he may still be swinging his\n          sword and advancing toward the room next to the lord\u2019s, he should cut\n          the man down. Indeed, one may be blamed later in an investigation as a\n          confederate of the killer, or as someone who had a grudge against him.\n          But at that time one should think only of cutting the man down and not\n          anticipate later blame.  Even if one\u2019s head were to be suddenly cut off, he should be able to\n          do one more action with certainty. The last moments of Nitta Yoshisada\n          are proof of this. Had his spirit been weak, he would have fallen the\n          moment his head was severed. Recently, there is the example of \u014cno\n          D\u014dken. These actions occurred because of simple determination. With\n          martial valor, if one becomes like a revengeful ghost and shows great\n          determination, though his head is cut off, he should not die.  Whether people be of high or low birth, rich or poor, old or young,\n          enlightened or confused, they are all alike in that they will one day\n          die. It is not that we don\u2019t know that we are going to die, but we\n          grasp at straws. While knowing that we will die someday, we think that\n          all the others will die before us and that we will be the last to go.\n          Death seems a long way off. Is this not shallow thinking? It is worthless and is only a joke\n          within a dream. It will not do to think in such a way and be\n          negligent. Insofar as death is always at one\u2019s door, one should make\n          sufficient effort and act quickly.  It is good to carry some powdered rouge in one\u2019s sleeve. It may happen\n          that when one is sobering up or waking from sleep, his complexion may\n          be poor. At such a time it is good to take out and apply some powdered\n          rouge.  There are times when a person gets carried away and talks on without\n          thinking much. But this can be seen by observers when one\u2019s mind is\n          flippant and lacking truth. After such an occasion it is best to come\n          face to face with the truth and express it. The truth will then be\n          arrived at in one\u2019s own heart, too. Even when greeting someone\n          lightly, one should consider the circumstances and after deliberation\n          speak in a way that will not injure the man\u2019s feelings. Furthermore, if there is a person who is criticizing the Way of the\n          Samurai or one\u2019s own province, one should speak with him severely,\n          without the least bit of ceremony. One must be resolved in advance.  Although a person who excels in an art regards others as competitors,\n          last year Hy\u014ddo Sach\u016b gave up the title of Master of\n          Renga to Yamaguchi Sh\u014dchin. A praiseworthy act.  The priest Tannen used to hang up wind-bells, but said, \u201cIt\u2019s not\n          because I like the sound. I hang them in order to know the wind\n          conditions in the event of fire, for that is the only worry in having\n          a large temple.\u201d When the wind blew, he himself walked about at night.\n          Throughout his whole life the fire in his brazier was never out, and\n          he always put a paper lantern and lighter by his pillow. He said,\n          \u201cPeople are flustered during an emergency, and there is no one to\n          quickly strike a light.\u201d  If one makes a distinction between public places and one\u2019s sleeping\n          quarters, or between being on the battlefield and on the\n          tatami, when the moment comes there will not be time for making\n          amends. There is only the matter of constant awareness. If it were not\n          for men who demonstrate valor on the tatami, one could not find\n          them on the battlefield either.  Bravery and cowardice are not things that can be conjectured in times\n          of peace. They are in different categories.  Though it may be said that the gods dislike impurity, if one thinks a\n          bit, he will see that he has not been negligent in his daily worship.\n          Thus, one\u2019s previous faithfulness has been exactly for the sake of\n          praying for good fortune in such times as when one is bathed in blood\n          and climbing over the dead. At such a time, if it is a god that turns\n          back when one is defiled, then one should know clearly that praying is\n          ineffective and should worship regardless of defilement.  At times of great trouble or disaster, one word will suffice. At times\n          of happiness, too, one word will be enough. And when meeting or\n          talking with others, one word will do. One should think well and then\n          speak. This is clear and firm, and one should learn it with no doubts.\n          It is a matter of putting forth one\u2019s whole effort and having the\n          correct attitude previously. This is very difficult to explain but is\n          something that everyone should work on in his heart. If a person has\n          not learned this in his heart, it is not likely that he will\n          understand it.  Human life is truly a short affair. It is better to live doing the\n          things that you like. It is foolish to live within this dream of a\n          world seeing unpleasantness and doing only things that you do not\n          like. But it is important never to tell this to young people as it is\n          something that would be harmful if incorrectly understood. Personally, I like to sleep. And I intend to appropriately confine\n          myself more and more to my living quarters and pass my life away\n          sleeping.  I had a dream on the night of the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth\n          month in the third year of Sh\u014dt\u014dku. The content of the dream changed\n          gradually to the extent that I strengthened my will. The condition of\n          a person is revealed by his dreams. It would be good to make\n          companions of your dreams and to put forth effort.  Shame and repentance are like upsetting a pot of water. When a certain\n          friend of mine listened to the way that a man who had stolen his sword\n          ornament confessed, he felt compassion. If one will rectify his\n          mistakes, their traces will soon disappear.  According to what the Buddhist priest Kaion said, a person becomes\n          more and more prideful if he gains a little understanding because he\n          thinks he knows his own limits and weak points. However, it is a\n          difficult thing to truly know one\u2019s own limits and weak points.  At a glance, every individual\u2019s own measure of dignity is manifested\n          just as it is. There is dignity in personal appearance. There is\n          dignity in a calm aspect. There is dignity in a paucity of words.\n          There is dignity in flawlessness of manners. There is dignity in\n          solemn behavior. And there is dignity in deep insight and a clear\n          perspective. These are all reflected on the surface. But in the end,\n          their foundation is simplicity of thought and tautness of spirit.  Covetousness, anger, and foolishness are things to sort out well. When\n          bad things happen in the world, if you look at them comparatively,\n          they are not unrelated to these three things. Looking comparatively at\n          the good things, you will see that they are not excluded from wisdom,\n          humanity, and bravery.  This is according to what Nakano Kazuma Toshiaki said. There are people who feel that using old utensils for the Tea Ceremony\n          is coarse, and that it is better to use new, clean utensils. There are\n          also people who are wont to use old materials because of their lack of\n          gaudiness. Both are mistaken. Old utensils, although they are things\n          that are used by the humble, are also used by the higher classes\n          because of their value. Their value is revered. A retainer is just like this. A person rises from the humble to the\n          higher classes because he has value. At the same time, to feel that a\n          person of no family cannot do the same work as one of higher family,\n          or that a man who has heretofore been only a foot soldier should not\n          be allowed to become a leader, is entirely wrong thinking. As for a\n          person who has risen from the humble, his value should be prized and\n          especially respected, even more than that of a person who was born\n          into his class.  My father Jin\u2019emon said that when he was young he was taken from time\n          to time to the entrance of the Chinese settlement in order to be\n          exposed to the atmosphere of the city and to become used to people.\n          From the time he was five years old he was sent as family\n          representative to various people\u2019s homes, and in order to make him\n          strong he was made to put on a warrior\u2019s straw sandals and visit the\n          temples of his ancestors from the time he was seven.  It is said that one will not be able to do great works if he does not\n          behave with some reserve towards his master, the chief retainers and\n          elders. What is done casually and freely will not work out well. It is\n          a matter of attitude.  It is unfitting that one be ignorant of the history and origins of his\n          clan and its retainers. But there are times when extensive knowledge\n          becomes a hindrance. One should use discretion. Knowing the\n          circumstances can be an obstruction in everyday affairs, too. One\n          should use discretion.  It is written that the priest Shungaku said, \u201cIn just refusing to\n          retreat from something one gains the strength of two men.\u201d This is\n          interesting. Something that is not done at that time and at that place\n          will remain unfinished for a lifetime. At a time when it is difficult\n          to complete matters with the strength of a single man, one will bring\n          it to a conclusion with the strength of two. If one thinks about it\n          later, he will be negligent all his life. \u201cStamp quickly and pass through a wall of iron\u201d is another interesting\n          phrase. To quickly break in and stamp through directly is the first\n          step of celerity. In connection with this, Hideyoshi can be thought of\n          as the only man who has grasped solidly the chance of a lifetime since\n          the creation of Japan.  People who talk on and on about matters of little importance probably\n          have some complaint in the back of their mind. But in order to be\n          ambiguous and to hide this they repeat what they are saying over and\n          over. To hear something like this causes doubt to arise in one\u2019s\n          breast.  One should be careful and not say things that are likely to cause\n          trouble at the time. When some difficulty arises in this world, people\n          get excited, and before one knows it the matter is on everyone\u2019s lips.\n          This is useless. If worse comes to worst, you may become the subject\n          of gossip, or at least you will have made enemies by saying something\n          unnecessary and will have created ill will. It is said that at such a\n          time it is better to stay at home and think of poetry.  To talk about other people\u2019s affairs is a great mistake. To praise\n          them, too, is unfitting. In any event, it is best to know your own\n          ability well, to put forth effort in your endeavors, and to be\n          discreet in speech.  The heart of a virtuous person has settled down and he does not rush\n          about at things. A person of little merit is not at peace but walks\n          about making trouble and is in conflict with all.  It is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream. When you have\n          something like a nightmare, you will wake up and tell yourself that it\n          was only a dream. It is said that the world we live in is not a bit\n          different from this.  People with intelligence will use it to fashion things both true and\n          false and will try to push through whatever they want with their\n          clever reasoning. This is injury from intelligence. Nothing you do will have effect if you do not use truth.  In affairs like law suits or even in arguments, by losing quickly one\n          will lose in fine fashion. It is like sum\u014d [wrestling]. If one thinks\n          only of winning, a sordid victory will be worse than a defeat. For the\n          most part, it becomes a squalid defeat.  Feeling deeply the difference between oneself and others, bearing ill\n          will, and falling out with people\u2014these things come from a heart that\n          lacks compassion. If one wraps up everything with a heart of\n          compassion, there will be no coming into conflict with people.  A person who knows but a little will put on an air of knowledge. This\n          is a matter of inexperience. When someone knows something well, it\n          will not be seen in his manner. This person is genteel.  When going someplace for a talk or something similar, it is best to\n          let the person know ahead of time, and then go. To go without knowing\n          whether the other party is busy, or when he has some particular\n          anxiety, is awkward. There is nothing that surpasses not going where\n          you have not been invited. Good friends are rare. Even if someone is\n          invited somewhere, he should use understanding. It is difficult to\n          feel deeply the sensitivities of people other than those who go out\n          only rarely. Fiascos at pleasure gatherings are numerous. However, you should not be brusque towards a person who has come to\n          visit, even if you are busy.  It is bad to carry even a good thing too far. Even concerning things\n          such as Buddhism, Buddhist sermons, and moral lessons, talking too\n          much will bring harm.  The late Jin\u2019emon said that it is better not to bring up daughters.\n          They are a blemish to the family name and a shame to the parents. The\n          eldest daughter is special, but it is better to disregard the others.  The priest Keih\u014d related that Lord Aki once said that martial valor is\n          a matter of becoming a fanatic. I thought that this was surprisingly\n          in accord with my own resolve and thereafter became more and more\n          extreme in my fanaticism.  The late Nakano Kazuma said that the original purpose of the Tea\n          Ceremony is to cleanse the six senses. For the eyes there are the\n          hanging scroll and flower arrangement. For the nose there is the\n          incense. For the ears there is the sound of the hot water. For the\n          mouth there is the taste of the tea. And for the hands and feet there\n          is the correctness of form. When the five senses have thus been\n          cleansed, the mind will of itself be purified. The Tea Ceremony will\n          cleanse the mind when the mind is clogged up. I do not depart from the\n          heart of the Tea Ceremony for twenty-four hours a day, yet this is\n          absolutely not a matter of tasteful living. Moreover, the tea utensils\n          are something that should be in accord with one\u2019s social position. In the poem, \u201cUnder the deep snows in the last village /\n          Last night numerous branches of plum blossomed,\u201d the opulence\n          of the phrase \u201cnumerous branches\u201d was changed to \u201ca single branch.\u201d It\n          is said that this \u201csingle branch\u201d contains true tranquility.  When intimate friends, allies, or people who are indebted to you have\n          done some wrong, you should secretly reprimand them and intervene\n          between them and society in a good manner. You should erase a person\u2019s\n          bad reputation and praise him as a matchless ally and one man in a\n          thousand. If you will thus reprimand a person in private and with good\n          understanding, his blemish will heal and he will become good. If you\n          praise a person, people\u2019s hearts will change and an ill reputation\n          will go away of itself. It is important to have the single purpose of\n          handling all things with compassion and doing things well.  A certain person said the following. There are two kinds of dispositions, inward and outward, and a person\n          who is lacking in one or the other is worthless. It is, for example,\n          like the blade of a sword, which one should sharpen well and then put\n          in its scabbard, periodically taking it out and knitting one\u2019s\n          eyebrows as in an attack, wiping off the blade, and then placing it in\n          its scabbard again. If a person has his sword out all the time, he is habitually swinging\n          a naked blade; people will not approach him and he will have no\n          allies. If a sword is always sheathed, it will become rusty, the blade will\n          dull, and people will think as much of its owner.  One cannot accomplish things simply with cleverness. One must take a\n          broad view. It will not do to make rash judgments concerning good and\n          evil. However, one should not be sluggish. It is said that one is not\n          truly a samurai if he does not make his decisions quickly and break\n          right through to completion.  Once, when a group of five or six pages were traveling to the capital\n          together in the same boat, it happened that their boat struck a\n          regular ship late at night. Five or six seamen from the ship leapt\n          aboard and loudly demanded that the pages give up their boat\u2019s anchor,\n          in accord with the seaman\u2019s code. Hearing this, the pages ran forward\n          yelling, \u201cThe seaman\u2019s code is something for people like you! Do you\n          think that we samurai are going to let you take equipment from a boat\n          carrying warriors? We will cut you down and throw you into the sea to\n          the last man!\u201d With that, all the seamen fled back to their own ship. At such a time, one must act like a samurai. For trifling occasions it\n          is better to accomplish things simply by yelling. By making something\n          more significant than it really is and missing one\u2019s chance, an affair\n          will not be brought to a close and will be no accomplishment at all.  A certain person who came up with a cash shortage when closing out an\n          account book sent a letter to his section leader saying, \u201cIt is\n          regrettable to have to commit seppuku over a matter of money. As you\n          are my section leader, please send some funds.\u201d Since this was\n          reasonable, the balance was provided and the matter was closed. It is\n          said that even wrongdoings can be managed without detection.  By being impatient, matters are damaged and great works cannot be\n          done. If one considers something not to be a matter of time, it will\n          be done surprisingly quickly. Times change. Think about the world\n          fifteen years from now. It should be rather different, but if one were\n          to look into a book of prophecies, I imagine that it would not be that\n          different. In the passing of fifteen years, not one of the useful men\n          of today will be left. And even if men who are young now come forth,\n          probably less than half will make it. Worth gradually wanes. For example, if there were a shortage of gold,\n          silver would become treasure, and if there were a shortage of silver,\n          copper would be valued. With changing times and the waning of men\u2019s\n          capacities, one would be of suitable worth even if he put forth only\n          slight effort. Something like fifteen years is the space of a dream.\n          If a man but takes care of his health, in the end he will have\n          accomplished his purpose and will be a valuable person. Certainly in a\n          period when masters are many, one must put forth considerable effort.\n          But at the time when the world is sliding into a decline, to excel is\n          easy.  To put forth great effort in correcting a person\u2019s bad habits is the\n          way it should be done. One should be like the digger wasp. It is said\n          that even with an adopted child, if you teach him continually so that\n          he will resemble you, he surely will.  If your strength is only that which comes from vitality, your words\n          and personal conduct will appear to be in accord with the Way, and you\n          will be praised by others. But when you question yourself about this,\n          there will be nothing to be said. The last line of the poem that goes\n          \u201cWhen your own heart asks\u201d is the secret principle of all the\n          arts. It is said that it is a good censor.  When you are listening to the stories of accomplished men and the\n          like, you should listen with deep sincerity, even if it\u2019s something\n          about which you already know. If in listening to the same thing ten or\n          twenty times it happens that you come to an unexpected understanding,\n          that moment will be very special. Within the tedious talk of old folks\n          are their meritorious deeds. Lord Naoshige once said, \u201cThere is nothing felt quite so deeply as\n          giri. There are times when someone like a cousin dies and it is\n          not a matter of shedding tears. But we may hear of someone who lived\n          fifty or a hundred years ago, of whom we know nothing and who has no\n          family ties with us whatsoever, and yet from a sense of\n          giri shed tears.\u201d  When Lord Naoshige was passing by a place called Chiriku, someone said\n          to him, \u201cIn this place there lives a man who is over ninety years old.\n          Since this man is so fortunate, why don\u2019t you stop and see him?\u201d\n          Naoshige heard this and said, \u201cHow could anyone be more pitiful than\n          this man? How many of his children and grandchildren do you suppose he\n          has seen fall before his very eyes? Where is the good fortune in\n          that?\u201d It seems that he did not stop to see the man.  When Lord Naoshige was speaking to his grandson, Lord Motoshige, he\n          said, \u201cNo matter whether one be of high or low rank, a family line is\n          something that will decline when its time has come. If one tries to\n          keep it from going to ruin at that time, it will have an unsightly\n          finish. If one thinks that the time has come, it is best to let it go\n          down with good grace. Doing so, he may even cause it to be\n          maintained.\u201d It is said that Motoshige\u2019s second son Naoaki heard this from him. When Nabeshima Tadanao was fifteen years old, a manservant in the\n          kitchen committed some rude act and a foot soldier was about to beat\n          him, but in the end the servant cut the soldier down. The clan elders\n          deemed the death sentence appropriate, saying that the man had in the\n          first place erred in matters concerning the ranks of men, and that he\n          had also shed the blood of his opponent. Tadanao heard this and said,\n          \u201cWhich is worse, to err in matters concerning the ranks of men or to\n          stray from the Way of the Samurai?\u201d The elders were unable to answer. Then Tadanao said, \u201cI have read that\n          when the crime itself is unclear, the punishment should be light. Put\n          him in confinement for a while.\u201d  Once, when Lord Katsushige was hunting at Shiroishi, he shot a large\n          boar. Everyone came running up to see it and said, \u201cWell, well. You\n          have brought down an uncommonly large one!\u201d Suddenly the boar got up\n          and dashed into their midst. All of them fled in confusion, but\n          Nabeshima Matabei drew his sword and finished it off. At that point,\n          Lord Katsushige covered his face with his sleeve and said, \u201cIt sure is\n          dusty.\u201d This was presumably because he did not want to see the\n          spectacle of his flustered men.  When Lord Katsushige was young, he was instructed by his father, Lord\n          Naoshige, \u201cFor practice in cutting, execute some men who have been\n          condemned to death.\u201d Thus, in the place that is now within the western\n          gate, ten men were lined up, and Katsushige continued to decapitate\n          one after another until he had executed nine of them. When he came to\n          the tenth, he saw that the man was young and healthy and said, \u201cI\u2019m\n          tired of cutting now. I\u2019ll spare this man\u2019s life.\u201d And the man\u2019s life\n          was saved.  Lord Katsushige always used to say that there are four kinds of\n          retainers. They are the \u201cquick, then lagging,\u201d the \u201clagging, then\n          quick,\u201d the \u201ccontinually quick,\u201d and the \u201ccontinually lagging.\u201d The \u201ccontinually quick\u201d are men who when given orders will undertake\n          their execution quickly and settle the matter well. Fukuchi\n          Kichizaemon and the like resemble this type. The \u201clagging, then quick\u201d are men who, though lacking in understanding\n          when given orders, prepare quickly and bring the matter to a\n          conclusion. I suppose that Nakano Kazuma and men similar are like\n          this. The \u201cquick, then lagging\u201d are men who when given orders seem to be\n          going to settle things but in their preparation take time and\n          procrastinate. There are many people like this. Other than these, one could say that the rest are \u201ccontinually\n          lagging.\u201d When Lord Takanobu was at the Battle of Bungo, a messenger came from\n          the enemy camp bearing sake and food. Takanobu wanted to partake of\n          this quickly, but the men at his side stopped him, saying, \u201cPresents\n          from the enemy are likely to be poisoned. This is not something that a\n          general should eat.\u201d Takanobu heard them out and then said, \u201cEven if it is poisoned, how\n          much of an effect would that have on things? Call the messenger here!\u201d\n          He then broke open the barrel right in front of the messenger, drank\n          three large cups of sake, offered the messenger one too, gave him a\n          reply, and sent him back to his camp.  Takagi Akifusa turned against the Ry\u016bz\u014dji clan, appealed to Maeda Iyo\n          no kami Iesada, and was sheltered by him. Akifusa was a warrior of\n          matchless valor and was an accomplished and agile swordsman. His\n          retainers were Ingazaemon and Fud\u014dzaemon, stalwarts in no way\n          inferior, and they left Akifusa\u2019s side neither day nor night. Thus it\n          happened that a request was sent from Lord Takanobu to Iesada to kill\n          Akifusa. At one point, when Akifusa was seated on the veranda having\n          Ingazaemon wash his feet, Iesada came running up behind him and struck\n          off his head. Before his head fell, Akifusa drew out his short sword\n          and turned to strike, but cut off Ingazaemon\u2019s head. The two heads\n          fell into the wash basin together. Akifusa\u2019s head then rose into the\n          midst of those present. This was the sort of magic technique that he\n          consistently had.  The priest Tannen used to say in his daily talks that: A monk cannot fulfill the Buddhist Way if he does not manifest\n          compassion without and persistently store up courage within. And if a\n          warrior does not manifest courage on the outside and hold enough\n          compassion within his heart to burst his chest, he cannot become a\n          retainer. Therefore, the monk pursues courage with the warrior as his\n          model, and the warrior pursues the compassion of the monk. I traveled about for many years and met men of wisdom, but never found\n          the means to the pursuit of knowledge. Therefore, whenever I heard of\n          a man of courage in one place or another, I would go and look for him\n          regardless of the hardships on the way. I have learned clearly that\n          these stories of the Way of the Samurai have been an aid on the road\n          to Buddhism. Now a warrior with his armor will rush into the enemy\n          camp, making that armor his strength. Do you suppose that a monk with\n          a single rosary can dash into the midst of spears and long swords,\n          armed with only meekness and compassion? If he does not have great\n          courage, he will do no dashing at all. As proof of this, the priest\n          offering the incense at a great Buddhist memorial service may tremble,\n          and this is because he has no courage. Things like kicking a man back from the dead, or pulling all living\n          creatures out of hell, are all matters of courage. Nevertheless, monks\n          of recent times all entertain false ideas and desire to become\n          laudably gentle; there are none who complete the Way. Furthermore,\n          among warriors there are some cowards who advance Buddhism. These are\n          regrettable matters. It is a great mistake for a young samurai to\n          learn about Buddhism. The reason is that he will see things in two\n          ways. A person who does not set himself in just one direction will be\n          of no value at all. It is fine for retired old men to learn about\n          Buddhism as a diversion, but if a warrior makes loyalty and filial\n          piety one load, and courage and compassion another, and carries these\n          twenty-four hours a day until his shoulders wear out, he will be a\n          samurai. In one\u2019s morning and evening worship, and as one goes about his day,\n          he had best recite the name of his master. It is not a bit different\n          from the Buddha\u2019s names and holy words. Furthermore, one should be in\n          harmony with his family gods. These are matters of the strength of\n          one\u2019s fate. Compassion is like a mother who nurtures one\u2019s fate.\n          Examples of the ruin of merciless warriors who were brave alone are\n          conspicuous in both past and present.  There was a certain point in the conversation when a retainer of Lord\n          Nabeshima Naohiro said, \u201cThere are no men here upon whom the master\n          can truly rely. Although I am consistently useless, I am the only one\n          who would throw away his life for you.\u201d It is said that Lord Naohiro got outrageously angry, saying, \u201cAmong\n          our retainers there is not a one who holds his life in regret! You are\n          talking arrogance!\u201d And he was at the point of striking him when the\n          man was pulled away by others who were there.  Once when Master Tanesada, the founder of the Chiba family, was coming\n          by sea to the island of Shikoku, a strong wind began blowing and the\n          boat was damaged. The boat was saved from sinking by abalone gathering\n          together and covering over the damaged sections. From that time on,\n          none of the Chiba family nor any of its retainers ate abalone. If one\n          of them mistakenly ate one, it is said that his body was covered with\n          boils in the shape of abalone.  At the fall of the castle at Arima, on the twenty-eighth day in the\n          vicinity of the inmost citadel, Mitsuse Genbei sat down on a levee\n          between the fields. When Nakano Shigetoshi passed by and asked the\n          reason for this, Mitsuse replied, \u201cI have abdominal pains and can\u2019t go\n          a step farther. I have sent the members of my group ahead, so please\n          take command.\u201d This situation was reported by the overseer, pronounced\n          to be a case of cowardice, and Mitsuse was ordered to commit seppuku. Long ago, abdominal pains were called \u201ccowardice grass.\u201d This is\n          because they come suddenly and render a person immobile.  At the time of Lord Nabeshima Naohiro\u2019s death, Lord Mitsushige forbade\n          Naohiro\u2019s retainers the practice of oibara. His messenger went\n          to Naohiro\u2019s mansion and made the declaration, but those who received\n          this news could in no way agree to it. From their midst, Ishimaru\n          Uneme (later called Seizaemon) spoke from the lowest seat, \u201cIt is\n          improper for me as a younger person to speak out, but I think that\n          what Lord Mitsushige has said is reasonable. As a person who received\n          the master\u2019s care when I was young, I had wholeheartedly decided on\n          oibara. But hearing Lord Mitsushige\u2019s dictum and being\n          convinced of his reasoning, no matter what the others may do, I am\n          giving up the idea of oibara and will serve the master\u2019s\n          successor.\u201d Hearing this, the others all followed suit.  Once Lord Masaie was playing shogi with Lord Hideyoshi and\n          there were a number of daimy\u014d watching. When it came time to withdraw,\n          although Lord Masaie could stand, his feet were numb and he could not\n          walk. He made his withdrawal crawling away, causing everyone to laugh.\n          Because Lord Masaie was big and obese he was not ordinarily able to be\n          on his knees. After this event he thought it would not be fitting to\n          be in attendance anymore and began refusing such duties.  Nakano Uemonnosuke Tadaaki was killed on the twelfth day of the eighth\n          month in the sixth year of Eiroku, at the time of the fight between\n          Master Got\u014d and Master Hirai of Suko on the island of Kabashima in the\n          Kishima district. When Uemonnosuke was leaving for the front lines, he\n          embraced his son Shikibu (later called Jin\u2019emon) in the garden and,\n          although Shikibu was very young, said, \u201cWhen you grow up, win honor in\n          the Way of the Samurai!\u201d Even when the children in his family were very young, Yamamoto\n          Jin\u2019emon would draw near to them and say, \u201cGrow up to be a great\n          stalwart, and be of good use to your master.\u201d He said, \u201cIt is good to\n          breathe these things into their ears even when they are too young to\n          understand.\u201d  When the late Ogawa Toshikiyo\u2019s legitimate son Sahei Kiyouji died as a\n          youth, there was one young retainer who galloped up to the temple and\n          committed seppuku.  When Taku Nagato no kami Yasutoshi passed away, Koga Yataemon said\n          that he had been unable to repay the master\u2019s kindness and committed\n          oibara. Narutomi Hy\u014dgo said, \u201cWhat is called winning is defeating one\u2019s\n          allies. Defeating one\u2019s allies is defeating oneself, and defeating\n          oneself is vigorously overcoming one\u2019s own body. \u201cIt is as though a man were in the midst of ten thousand allies but\n          not a one were following him. If one hasn\u2019t previously mastered his\n          mind and body, he will not defeat the enemy.\u201d  During the Shimabara Rebellion, his armor being still at the\n          encampment, Shugy\u014d Echizen no kami Tanenao participated in the fight\n          dressed only in\n          hakama and haori. It is said that he died in battle in\n          this attire.  At the time of the attack on the castle at Shimabara, Tazaki Geki was\n          wearing very resplendent armor. Lord Katsushige was not pleased by\n          this, and after that every time he saw something showy he would say,\n          \u201cThat\u2019s just like Geki\u2019s armor.\u201d In the light of this story, military armor and equipment that are\n          showy can be seen as being weak and having no strength. By them one\n          can see through the wearer\u2019s heart.  When Nabeshima Hizen no kami Tadanao died, his attendant Ezoe Kinbei\n          took his remains and had them consecrated at Mt. K\u014dya. Then, confining\n          himself in a hermitage, he carved a statue of his master and another\n          of himself doing reverence before the master. On the first anniversary\n          of Tadanao\u2019s death, he returned to his home and committed\n          oibara. Later the statue was taken from Mt. K\u014dya and was placed\n          at the K\u014ddenji.  In the generation of Lord Mitsushige, \u014cishi Kosuke was at first a foot\n          soldier serving at the side of his master. Whenever Lord Mitsushige\n          was making the trip for his alternate-year residence in Edo, Kosuke\n          would make the rounds around the sleeping quarters of his master, and\n          if he thought a certain area to be insecure, he would spread a straw\n          mat and pass through the night awake by himself. In rainy weather he\n          would simply wear a bamboo hat and an oilpaper raincoat and would\n          stand watch while being pelted by the rain. It is said that to the end\n          he never spent a single night in negligence.  When \u014cishi Kosuke was an uchit\u014dnin, a mysterious person sneaked\n          into the area of the maids\u2019 chambers late at night. There was a great\n          commotion from upstairs to down and men and women of all ranks were\n          running about; only Kosuke was not to be seen. While the senior\n          ladies-in-waiting were searching about, Kosuke yanked his sword from\n          its scabbard and waited quietly in the room next to the master\u2019s\n          bedchamber. As all was in confusion, he had felt apprehension for the\n          master and was there to protect him. Because of this it was said that\n          his viewpoint was quite different. The man who had sneaked in was Narutomi Kichibei. He and his\n          accomplice Hamada Ichizaemon were condemned to death for adultery.  Once when Lord Katsushige was hunting at Nishime, for some reason he\n          got very angry. He drew his sword from his obi, scabbard and all, and\n          began beating Soejima Zennoj\u014d with it, but his hand slipped and his\n          sword fell into a ravine. Zennoj\u014d, in order to stay with the sword,\n          tumbled down into the ravine and picked it up. This done, he stuck the\n          sword in his lapel, crawled up the precipice, and just as he was,\n          offered the sword to his master. In terms of quick-mindedness and\n          reserve this was matchless resource.  Once when Master Sano Uky\u014d was crossing over the Takao River, the\n          bridge was being repaired and there was one large piling that could\n          not be pulled up. Master Uky\u014d dismounted, grasped the piling firmly,\n          gave a shout, and began to pull it up. There was a tremendous sound,\n          and although he was able to pull it up to his own height, it would go\n          no further and thereupon sank. After he returned home he became sick\n          and suddenly died. At the time of the funeral at the temple in J\u014dbaru, when the funeral\n          procession crossed the Takao Bridge, the corpse leapt from the casket\n          and fell into the river. A sixteen-year-old acolyte from the Shufukuji\n          immediately jumped into the river and took hold of the dead body.\n          Everyone then ran down into the river and pulled up the corpse. The\n          head monk was very impressed and instructed the other acolytes to be\n          guided by this young man. It is said that he later became a very\n          famous monk.  Yamamoto Kichizaemon was ordered by his father Jin\u2019emon to cut down a\n          dog at the age of five, and at the age of fifteen he was made to\n          execute a criminal. Everyone, by the time they were fourteen or\n          fifteen, was ordered to do a beheading without fail. When Lord\n          Katsushige was young, he was ordered by Lord Naoshige to practice\n          killing with a sword. It is said that at that time he was made to cut\n          down more than ten men successively. A long time ago this practice was followed, especially in the upper\n          classes, but today even the children of the lower classes perform no\n          executions, and this is extreme negligence. To say that one can do\n          without this sort of thing, or that there is no merit in killing a\n          condemned man, or that it is a crime, or that it is defiling, is to\n          make excuses. In short, can it not be thought that because a person\u2019s\n          martial valor is weak, his attitude is only that of trimming his nails\n          and being attractive? If one investigates into the spirit of a man who finds these things\n          disagreeable, one sees that this person gives himself over to\n          cleverness and excuse making not to kill because he feels unnerved.\n          But Naoshige made it his orders exactly because this is something that\n          must be done. Last year I went to the Kase Execution Grounds to try my hand at\n          beheading, and I found it to be an extremely good feeling. To think\n          that it is unnerving is a symptom of cowardice.  Among the pageboys in forelocks in Lord Mitsushige\u2019s retinue, one\n          Tomoda Sh\u014dzaemon was in attendance. A rather wanton fellow, he fell in\n          love with a leading actor of the theater by the name of Tamon\n          Sh\u014dzaemon and changed both his name and his crest to that of the\n          actor. Completely abandoning himself to this affair, he spent\n          everything he had and lost all his clothing and furnishings. And at\n          length, when he had exhausted all his means, he stole Mawatari\n          Rokubei\u2019s sword and had a spearman take it to a pawnshop. The spearman, however, spoke up about this matter, and in the\n          investigation both he and Sh\u014dzaemon were condemned to death. The\n          investigator was Yamamoto Gor\u014dzaemon. When he read the report, he\n          spoke in a loud voice and said, \u201cThe man who accuses the defendant is\n          Spearman so-and-so.\u201d Mitsushige responded quickly, \u201cPut him to death.\u201d When it came time to announce his fate to Sh\u014dzaemon, Gor\u014dzaemon came\n          in and said, \u201cThere is now nothing left to be done for you. Prepare\n          yourself for your place of death.\u201d Sh\u014dzaemon settled himself and said, \u201cVery well. I understand what you\n          have said and am grateful for your words.\u201d Due to somebody\u2019s trickery,\n          however, while a kaishaku was introduced to Sh\u014dzaemon, it was\n          arranged that a foot soldier, Naozuka Rokuuemon, was to step from the\n          side and decapitate him. Repairing to the execution grounds, where the kaishaku stood\n          opposite him, Sh\u014dzaemon saluted him with extreme calm. But just then,\n          seeing Naozuka drawing his sword, he jumped up and said, \u201cWho are you?\n          I\u2019ll never let you cut off my head!\u201d From that point on his peace of\n          mind was shattered and he showed terrible cowardice. Finally he was\n          brought to the ground, stretched out, and decapitated. Gor\u014dzaemon later said secretly, \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t been deceived, he would\n          have probably met his death well.\u201d  Noda Kizaemon said about the function of kaishaku, \u201cWhen a man\n          who has come to his place of death loses his wits and is crawling\n          about, it is likely some damage will be done when it comes time to\n          perform kaishaku. At such a time, first wait a bit and by some\n          means gather your strength. Then if you cut by standing firm and not\n          missing the chance, you will do well.\u201d  In the generation of Lord Katsushige, there were retainers who,\n          regardless of high or low rank, were requested to work before the\n          master from the time they were young. When Shiba Kizaemon was doing\n          such service, once the master was clipping his nails and said, \u201cThrow\n          these away.\u201d Kizaemon held them in his hand but did not stand up, and\n          the master said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Kizaemon said, \u201cThere\u2019s one\n          missing.\u201d The master said, \u201cHere it is,\u201d and handed over the one that\n          he had hidden.  Sawabe Heizaemon was ordered to commit seppuku on the eleventh day of\n          the eleventh month in the second year of Tenna. As this became known\n          to him on the night of the tenth, he sent a request to Yamamoto\n          Gonnoj\u014d [Tsunetomo] to be kaishaku. The following is a copy of\n          Yamamoto\u2019s reply. (Tsunetomo was twenty-four years old at this time.) I am in accord with your resolution and accept your request for me to\n          function as kaishaku. I instinctively felt that I should\n          decline, but as this is to take place tomorrow there is no time for\n          making excuses and I will undertake the job. The fact that you have\n          chosen me from among many people is a great personal satisfaction to\n          me. Please set your mind at ease concerning all that must follow.\n          Although it is now late at night, I will come to your house to talk\n          over the particulars. When Heizaemon saw this reply, it is said that he remarked, \u201cThis is a\n          matchless letter.\u201d From ages past it has been considered ill-omened by samurai to be\n          requested as kaishaku. The reason for this is that one gains no\n          fame even if the job is well done. And if by chance one should\n          blunder, it becomes a lifetime disgrace.  Once when Tanaka Yahei was attending to affairs in Edo, one of his\n          menials was rather insolent and Yahei scolded him severely. Late that\n          night Yahei heard the noise of someone coming up the stairs. He felt\n          this to be suspicious and quietly got up. With short sword in hand he\n          asked who was there, and it turned out to be the menial whom he had\n          scolded previously, secretly holding a short sword. Yahei leapt down\n          and with a single stroke cut the man down. I heard many people later\n          state that he had had good luck.  A certain Master Tokuhisa was born quite different from other people\n          and looked to be a bit moronic. Once, a guest was invited and mudfish\n          salad was served. At that time everyone said, \u201cMaster Tokuhisa\u2019s\n          mudfish salad,\u201d and laughed. Later when he was in attendance and a\n          certain person made fun of him by quoting the above remark, Tokuhisa\n          pulled out his sword and cut the man down. This event was investigated\n          and it was stated to Lord Naoshige, \u201cSeppuku is recommended because\n          this was a matter of rashness within the palace.\u201d When Lord Naoshige heard this, he said, \u201cTo be made fun of and remain\n          silent is cowardice. There is no reason to overlook this fact because\n          one is within the palace. A man who makes fun of people is himself a\n          fool. It was his own fault for being cut down.\u201d  Once when Nakano Mokunosuke boarded a small boat on the Sumida River\n          to enjoy the coolness, a rogue got in, too, and committed all manner\n          of rude acts. When Mokunosuke saw that the rogue was relieving himself\n          over the side of the boat, he cut the man\u2019s head off and it fell into\n          the river. So that people would not notice this, he quickly covered\n          the body with various things. He then said to the boatman, \u201cThis\n          matter should not become known. Row up to the upper reaches of the\n          river and bury the corpse. I shall naturally pay you well.\u201d The boatman did as he was told, but in the lagoon where the body was\n          buried, Mokunosuke cut off the head of the boatman and returned\n          directly. It is said that this fact never became known publicly. At\n          that time there was also one young homosexual male prostitute riding\n          in the boat. Mokunosuke said, \u201cThat fellow was a man, too. It is best\n          to learn how to cut a man while one is still young,\u201d and so the man\n          cut the corpse once. Because of that the young man said nothing later\n          on.  It is said that every time, the late \u014cki Hy\u014dbu\u2019s group gathered and\n          after all their affairs were finished he would say, \u201cYoung men should\n          discipline themselves rigorously in intention and courage. This will\n          be accomplished if only courage is fixed in one\u2019s heart. If one\u2019s\n          sword is broken, he will strike with his hands. If his hands are cut\n          off, he will press the enemy down with his shoulders. If his shoulders\n          are cut away, he will bite through ten or fifteen enemy necks with his\n          teeth. Courage is such a thing.\u201d  Shida Kichinosuke said, \u201cAt first it is an oppressive thing to run\n          until one is breathless. But it is an extraordinarily good feeling\n          when one is standing around after the running. More than that, it is\n          even better to sit down. More than that, it is even better to lie\n          down. And more than that, to put down a pillow and sleep soundly is\n          even better. A man\u2019s whole life should be like this. To exert oneself\n          to a great extent when one is young and then to sleep when he is old\n          or at the point of death is the way it should be. But to first sleep\n          and then exert oneself . . . to exert oneself to the end, and to end\n          one\u2019s whole life in toil is regrettable.\u201d Shimomura Rokur\u014duemon told\n          this story. A saying of Kichinosuke\u2019s that is similar to this is, \u201cA man\u2019s life\n          should be as toilsome as possible.\u201d  When Ueno Rihei was overseer of accounting in Edo, he had a young\n          assistant whom he treated in a very intimate way. On the first night\n          of the eighth month he went drinking with Hashimoto Taemon, an\n          overseer of foot soldiers, and got so drunk that he lost good sense.\n          He accompanied his young assistant back home, babbling on in a drunken\n          manner, and when they arrived there, Rihei said that he was going to\n          cut the assistant down. The assistant pushed away the tip of Rihei\u2019s\n          scabbard. They grappled and both fell into the gutter with the\n          assistant on top pushing Rihei down. At this time, Rihei\u2019s servant ran up and asked, \u201cIs Master Rihei on\n          the top or on the bottom?\u201d When Rihei replied, \u201cI\u2019m on the bottom!\u201d the servant stabbed the\n          assistant once. The assistant got up and, as his wound was light, ran\n          away. When the affair was brought under investigation, Rihei was put into\n          confinement at the Naekiyama prison and was condemned to capital\n          punishment by beheading. Before this, when he was positioned in Edo\n          and living in a rented house in the merchants\u2019 district, a servant had\n          opposed him and he had cut him down. But he had acted in a good way at\n          that time, and people said that he had acted like a man. This time,\n          however, his actions were outrageous and were certainly unnecessary. If one thinks about this well from beginning to end, to get so drunk\n          as to draw one\u2019s sword is both cowardice and lack of resolve. Rihei\u2019s\n          servant was a man from Taku, but his name is not remembered. Though he\n          was a member of the lower classes, he was a brave man. It is said that\n          Taemon committed suicide during the investigation.  In the twelfth section of the fifth chapter of the Roanky\u014d by\n          Suzuki Sh\u014dsan, there is this story: In the Province of Hizen there was a certain man from Taku who,\n          although he had contracted smallpox, was considering joining the\n          forces attacking the castle at Shimabara. His parents earnestly tried\n          to get him to desist, saying, \u201cWith such a grave illness, even if you\n          should get there, how could you be of any use?\u201d He replied, \u201cIt would be to my satisfaction to die on the way. After\n          having received the warm benevolence of the master, should I tell\n          myself that I will be of no use to him now?\u201d And he left for the\n          front. Although it was winter camp and the cold was extreme, he did\n          not pay any attention to his health, and neither put on many layers of\n          clothing nor took off his armor day or night. Moreover, he did not\n          avoid uncleanliness, and in the end recovered quickly and was able to\n          fulfill his loyalty completely. So to the contrary of what you would\n          expect, it cannot be said that one is to despise uncleanliness. When I [Suzuki Sh\u014dsan] heard this, I said, \u201cWas it not a cleansing act\n          to throw away his life for his master? For a man who will cut off his\n          life for the sake of righteousness, there is no need to call upon the\n          god of smallpox. All the gods of heaven will protect him.\u201d  Lord Katsushige said, \u201cWhether a man of Hizen holds death in regret or\n          not is not a matter of concern. What I worry about is that people will\n          not take to heart the command to keep the rules of manners and\n          etiquette correctly. I am afraid that the entire clan, our relatives\n          and elders, out of too much earnestness, will feel that the command to\n          keep correct etiquette is an exaggeration. Up to now there have\n          existed men who were used to these things, and even if etiquette was\n          slightly wrong, they could remember the correct way, and the matter\n          was settled. I have given this command because people are negligent in\n          affairs of this sort.\u201d  During the Genroku period, there was a samurai of low rank from the\n          Province of Ise by the name of Suzuki Rokubei. He was ill with a\n          severe fever, and his consciousness became dim. At that time a certain\n          male nurse was unexpectedly stricken with greed and was about to open\n          up the inkbox and steal the money that was kept in it. Just then the\n          sick man suddenly stirred, took the sword from the base of his pillow,\n          and in a sudden attack cut the man down with one blow. With that, the\n          sick man fell back and died. By this act, Rokubei seemed to be a man\n          of principled disposition. I heard this story in Edo, but later when I was serving in the same\n          province with a Dr. Natsuka, who was also from the Province of Ise, I\n          asked him about it, and indeed he knew the story and said that it was\n          true. On the night of the thirteenth day of the ninth month in the fourth\n          year of Teiky\u014d, there was a group of ten Noh actors moon-viewing at\n          the house of Nakayama Mosuke, a foot soldier, in Sayanomoto. Beginning\n          with Naotsuka Kanzaemon, they all began to make fun of the foot\n          soldier Araki Ky\u016bzaemon because he was so short. Araki became angry,\n          killed Kanzaemon with his sword, and then began striking at the\n          others. Though he suffered a severed hand, Matsumoto Rokuzaemon came down into\n          the garden, seized Araki from behind with his other hand, and said,\n          \u201cAs for the likes of you, I\u2019ll twist your head off with one hand!\u201d\n          Grabbing away Araki\u2019s sword, he pushed him to the doorsill and pressed\n          him down with his knee, but as he seized him by the neck he became\n          faint and was quickly overpowered. Araki quickly sprang back and again began to strike at those around\n          him, but now Master Hayata (later known as Jir\u014dzaemon) met him with a\n          spear. In the end he was overpowered by a number of men. Following\n          this, Araki was made to commit seppuku, and the others who were\n          involved were all made r\u014dnin on account of their indiscretion, but\n          Hayata was later pardoned. As Tsunetomo does not remember this story clearly, one should ask\n          around about it.  Some years ago, there was a sutra reading at the Jiss\u014din in Kawakami.\n          Five or six men from Kon\u2019yamachi and the area of Tashiro had gone to\n          the service, and on their way home passed some time drinking. Among\n          them was one of Kizuka Ky\u016bzaemon\u2019s retainers who, having some reason\n          for doing so, turned down his companions\u2019 invitation to join them and\n          returned home before nightfall. The others, however, later got into a\n          fight with some men and cut them all down. Ky\u016bzaemon\u2019s retainer heard\n          of this late that night and went quickly to his companions\u2019 quarters.\n          He listened to the details and then said, \u201cIn the end I suppose you\n          will have to submit a statement. When you do, you should say that I\n          was there also and assisted in cutting down those men. When I return,\n          I will say as much to Ky\u016bzaemon. Since a fight is a matter involving\n          all concerned, I should meet the same death sentence as you. And that\n          is my deepest desire. The reason is that even if I were to explain to\n          my master that I had returned home early, he would never accept it as\n          the truth. Ky\u016bzaemon has always been a severe man, and even if I were\n          cleared by the investigators, he would probably have me executed as a\n          coward right before his eyes. In such a case, dying with the bad\n          reputation of having run away from a place would be extremely\n          regretful. \u201cSince the fate of dying is the same, I would like to die being blamed\n          for having killed a man. If you are not in agreement with this, I will\n          cut my stomach open right here.\u201d Having no alternative, his companions spoke as he had requested.\n          Presently, during the inquiry, although the circumstances were\n          explained in the above manner, it became known that the retainer had\n          returned home early. All the investigators were impressed and in fact\n          praised the man. This matter was transmitted to me only in outline, so I will look into\n          the details at a later date.  Once when Nabeshima Aki no kami Shigemasa was halfway through his\n          meal, a guest suddenly came to see him, and he left his tray just as\n          it was. Later, a certain retainer of his sat down at the tray and\n          began eating the fried fish that was on it. Just then Lord Aki came\n          back and saw him, and the man became flustered and ran off. Lord Aki\n          yelled out, \u201cWhat a low-life slave you are to eat something that\n          someone else has been eating!\u201d and sat down and finished what was\n          left. This is one of Jin\u2019emon\u2019s stories. It is said that this retainer was\n          one of those who committed oibara for the master.  The late Yamamoto Jin\u2019emon always said to his retainers, \u201cGo ahead and\n          gamble and lie. A person who will not tell you seven lies within a\n          hundred yards is useless as a man.\u201d Long ago people spoke in this\n          fashion because they were only concerned with a man\u2019s attitude towards\n          military matters and considered that a man who was \u201ccorrect\u201d would\n          never do great works. They also ignored the misconduct of men and\n          dismissed such matters by saying, \u201cThey do good works, too . . .\u201d Men like Sagara Ky\u016bma also excused retainers who had committed theft\n          and adultery and trained them gradually. He said, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for\n          such persons, we would have no useful men at all.\u201d  Ikuno Oribe said, \u201cIf a retainer will just think about what he is to\n          do for the day at hand, he will be able to do anything. If it is a\n          single day\u2019s work, one should be able to put up with it. Tomorrow,\n          too, is but a single day.\u201d  At the time when Lord Nabeshima Tsunashige had still not taken over as\n          heir, he was converted by the Zen priest Kurotakiyama Ch\u014don and\n          learned Buddhism from him. Since he had had an enlightenment, the\n          priest was going to confer the seal upon him, and this became known\n          throughout the mansion. At that time Yamamoto Gor\u014dzaemon had been\n          ordered to be both Tsunashige\u2019s attendant and overseer. When he heard\n          of this, he knew that it absolutely would not do and planned to make a\n          request to Ch\u014don, and if he did not assent, kill him. He went to the\n          priest\u2019s house in Edo and entered; the priest, thinking that he was\n          someone on a pilgrimage, met him in a dignified manner. Gor\u014dzaemon drew near him and said, \u201cI have some secret thing to tell\n          you directly. Please send out your attendant priests. \u201cIt is said that you will soon award Tsunashige the seal because of\n          his cleverness in Buddhism. Now as you are from Hizen, you should know\n          in large part the customs of the Ry\u016bz\u014dji and Nabeshima clans. Our\n          country is ruled with harmony between high and low because, unlike\n          others, it has had continuous heirs for successive generations. There\n          has never been the taking of a Buddhist seal by the daimy\u014d for ages\n          past. If you present the seal now, Tsunashige will probably think of\n          himself as enlightened and regard what his retainers say as so much\n          dirt. A great man will become vain. Absolutely do not give this award.\n          If you do not agree to this, I too am resolved.\u201d This he said with\n          determination. The priest\u2019s color changed, but he said, \u201cWell, well. You have\n          trustworthy intentions, and I see that you understand the affairs of\n          your clan well. You are a loyal retainer . . .\u201d But Gor\u014dzaemon said, \u201cNo! I understand that ploy. I didn\u2019t come here\n          to be praised. Without adding anything else, let me hear clearly\n          whether you plan to cancel the seal or not.\u201d Ch\u014don said, \u201cWhat you say is reasonable. I will definitely not award\n          the seal.\u201d Gor\u014dzaemon made sure of this and returned. Tsunetomo heard this story directly from Gor\u014dzaemon.  A group of eight samurai (Komori Eijun, \u014ctsubo Jin\u2019emon, Mut\u014d\n          Rokuemon, Shikae Mozaemon, Yoshii Yoichiemon, Ezoe Jinbei, Muta\n          Rokunosuke, Niwa Kizaemon) all took the same road for some\n          merrymaking. Two of them, Komori Eijun and \u014ctsub\u014d Jin\u2019emon, went into\n          a teahouse in front of the Kannon temple at Asakusa, got into an\n          argument with the male employees there, and were soundly beaten. This\n          could be heard by the others, who were in an excursion boat, and Mut\u014d\n          Rokuemon said, \u201cWe should go back and take revenge.\u201d Yoshii Yoichiemon\n          and Ezoe Jinbei both agreed to this. The others, however, dissuaded them, saying, \u201cThis will cause trouble\n          for the clan,\u201d and they all returned home. When they arrived at the mansion, Rokuemon again said, \u201cWe should\n          definitely take revenge!\u201d but the others dissuaded him. Although they\n          sustained heavy wounds on their arms and legs, Eijun and Jin\u2019emon cut\n          the teahouse men down, and those who had returned were taken to task\n          by the master. In due course some thought was given to the details of this event. One\n          person said, \u201cBy waiting to get the agreement of others, a matter like\n          taking revenge will never be brought to a conclusion. One should have\n          the resolution to go alone and even to be cut down. A person who\n          speaks vehemently about taking revenge but does nothing about it is a\n          hypocrite. Clever people, by using their mouths alone, are taking care\n          of their reputations for a later date. But a real stalwart is a man\n          who will go out secretly, saying nothing, and die. It is not necessary\n          to achieve one\u2019s aim; one is a stalwart in being cut down. Such a\n          person will most likely achieve his purpose.\u201d  Ichiy\u016bken was a low-class servant in the kitchen of Lord Takanobu.\n          Because of some grudge he had over a matter of wrestling, he cut down\n          seven or eight men and was hence ordered to commit suicide. But when\n          Lord Takanobu heard of this he pardoned the man and said, \u201cIn these\n          strifetorn times of our country, brave men are important. This man\n          would seem to be a man of bravery.\u201d Consequently, at the time of the\n          action around the Uji River, Lord Takanobu took Ichiy\u016bken along, and\n          the latter earned unrivaled fame, advancing deep into the lead and\n          plundering the enemy every time. At the battle of Takagi, Ichiy\u016bken went so far into the enemy lines\n          that Lord Takanobu felt regret and called him back. Since the vanguard\n          had been unable to advance, only by quickly dashing out was he able to\n          grab Ichiy\u016bken by the sleeve of his armor. At that time Ichiy\u016bken\u2019s\n          head had suffered many wounds, but he had stopped them up with green\n          leaves which he bound with a thin towel.  On the first day of the attack on Hara Castle, Tsuruta Yashichibei\n          went as a messenger from Lord Mimasaka to \u014cki Hy\u014dbu, but as he was\n          delivering the message, he was shot through the pelvic region by a\n          bullet fired from the castle and instantly fell on his face. He got up\n          again and delivered the rest of the message, was felled a second time,\n          and died. Yashichibei\u2019s body was carried back by Taira Senbei. When\n          Senbei was returning to Hy\u014dbu\u2019s camp, he too was struck by a rifle\n          ball and died.  Denko was born in Taku, and the members of his family living at this\n          time were his elder brother Jirobei, his younger brother, and his\n          mother. Around the ninth month Denko\u2019s mother took Jirobei\u2019s son with\n          her to hear a sermon. When it was time to go home, the child, as he\n          was putting on his straw sandals, accidentally stepped on the foot of\n          the man next to him. The man rebuked the child, and in the end they\n          got into a vehement argument and the man unsheathed his short sword\n          and killed him. Jirobei\u2019s mother was dumbstruck. She clung to the man,\n          and he killed her, too. Having done this, the man returned to his\n          house. This man\u2019s name was Gor\u014demon, and he was the son of a r\u014dnin by the\n          name of Nakajima Moan. His younger brother was the mountain ascetic,\n          Ch\u016bz\u014db\u014d. Moan was an advisor to Master Mimasaka, and Gor\u014demon had been\n          given a stipend also. When the circumstances became known at Jirobei\u2019s home, his younger\n          brother set out for Gor\u014demon\u2019s place. Finding that the door was locked\n          from within and that no one would come out, he disguised his voice,\n          pretending to be a visitor. When the door was opened, he shouted his\n          real name and crossed swords with his enemy. Both men tumbled into the\n          rubbish heap, but in the end Gor\u014demon was killed. At this point,\n          Ch\u016bz\u014db\u014d dashed in and cut down Jirobei\u2019s younger brother. Hearing of this incident, Denko went immediately to Jirobei\u2019s place\n          and said, \u201cOf our enemies only one has been killed, while we have lost\n          three. This is extremely regrettable, so why don\u2019t you strike at\n          Ch\u016bz\u014db\u014d?\u201d Jirobei, however, would not comply. Denko felt that this was indeed shameful, and although a Buddhist\n          priest, he decided on striking at the enemy of his mother, younger\n          brother, and nephew. He knew, nevertheless, that since he was simply\n          an ordinary priest, there was likely to be a reprisal from Master\n          Mimasaka and therefore worked hard, finally gaining eminence as the\n          chief priest of the Ry\u016bunji. He then went to the sword maker Iyonoj\u014d\n          and asked him to make both a long and a short sword, offered to be his\n          apprentice, and was even allowed to take part in the work. By the twenty-third day of the ninth month of the following year, he\n          was ready to make his departure. By chance a guest had come at this\n          time. Giving orders for food to be served, Denko secretly slipped out\n          of the chief priest\u2019s headquarters disguised as a layman. He then went\n          to Taku and, upon asking about Ch\u016bz\u014db\u014d, learned that he was with a\n          large group of people who had gathered to watch the moonrise, and that\n          therefore nothing much could be done. Unwilling to let time pile up,\n          he felt that it would be fulfilling his basic desire to strike at the\n          father, Moan. Going to Moan\u2019s house, he forced his way into the\n          sleeping chambers, announced his name, and when the man began to get\n          up, stabbed and killed him. When the people of the neighborhood came\n          running and surrounded him, he explained the situation, threw away\n          both long and short swords, and returned home. News of this preceded\n          him to Saga, and a good number of Denko\u2019s parishioners came out\n          quickly and accompanied him on his return. Master Mimasaka was quite outraged, but as Denko was the chief priest\n          of a Nabeshima clan temple, there was nothing to be done. Finally,\n          through the offices of Nabeshima Toneri, he sent word to Tannen, the\n          chief priest of the K\u014ddenji, saying, \u201cWhen a priest has killed a man,\n          he should be given a sentence of death.\u201d Tannen\u2019s reply was, \u201cThe\n          punishment for one within the religion will be in accordance with the\n          feelings of the K\u014ddenji. Kindly do not interfere.\u201d Master Mimasaka became even angrier and asked, \u201cWhat sort of\n          punishment will this be?\u201d Tannen replied, \u201cAlthough it is profitless\n          for you to know, you are forcing the question, so I will give you an\n          answer. The [Buddhist] Law is that an apostate priest is deprived of\n          his robes and driven out.\u201d Denko\u2019s robes were taken from him at the K\u014ddenji, and when he was to\n          be driven out, some novices put on their long and short swords, and a\n          great number of parishioners came to protect him, accompanying him as\n          far as Todoroki. On the road, a number of men who looked like hunters\n          appeared and asked if the party had come from Taku. Thereafter Denko\n          lived in Chikuzen, was well received by all, and was on friendly terms\n          with samurai as well. This story was widely circulated, and it is said\n          that he was treated kindly everywhere.  Horie San\u2019emon\u2019s misdeed was robbing the Nabeshima warehouse in Edo of\n          its money and fleeing to another province. He was caught and\n          confessed. Thus it was pronounced, \u201cBecause this is a grave crime he\n          should be tortured to death,\u201d and Nakano Daigaku was ordered to be the\n          official who verified the execution. At first all the hairs on his\n          body were burned off and his fingernails were pulled out. His tendons\n          were then cut, he was bored with drills and subjected to various other\n          tortures. Throughout, he did not flinch once, nor did his face change\n          color. In the end his back was split, he was boiled in soy sauce, and\n          his body was bent back in two.  Once when Fukuchi Rokur\u014demon was leaving the castle, the palanquin of\n          what appeared to be a rather upper-class woman was passing in front of\n          Master Taku\u2019s mansion, and a man who was standing there made the\n          proper salutation. A halberd carrier who was with the palanquin\n          procession, however, said to the man, \u201cYou didn\u2019t bow low enough,\u201d and\n          struck him on the head with the handle of his halberd. When the man wiped his head, he found that he was bleeding. In just\n          that condition he stood up and said, \u201cYou have committed an outrageous\n          act, even though I was courteous. A regrettable piece of luck.\u201d So\n          saying, he cut the halberd carrier down with a single blow. The palanquin continued on to wherever it was going, but Rokur\u014demon\n          unsheathed his spear, stood before the man, and said, \u201cPut away your\n          sword. Within the castle grounds it is forbidden to go about holding a\n          naked blade.\u201d The man said, \u201cWhat happened now was unavoidable, and I was compelled\n          by the circumstances. Certainly you could see that this was so.\n          Although I would like to sheathe my sword, it is difficult to do so\n          due to the tone of your words. It is unpleasant, but I shall be glad\n          to accept your challenge.\u201d Rokur\u014demon immediately threw down his spear and said courteously,\n          \u201cWhat you have said is reasonable. My name is Fukuchi Rokur\u014demon. I\n          will bear witness that your conduct was quite admirable. Moreover, I\n          will back you up even if it means forfeiting my life. Now put away\n          your sword.\u201d \u201cWith pleasure,\u201d the man said, and sheathed his sword. On being asked where he was from, the man replied that he was a\n          retainer of Taku Nagato no kami Yasutoshi. Therefore Rokur\u014demon\n          accompanied him and explained the circumstances. Knowing that the\n          woman in the palanquin was the wife of a nobleman, however, Lord\n          Nagato ordered his retainer to commit seppuku. Rokur\u014demon came forward and said, \u201cBecause I have given the promise of\n          a samurai, if this man is ordered to commit seppuku, then I will\n          commit seppuku first.\u201d It is said that the affair was thus finished without mishap.  Lord Shima sent a messenger to his father, Lord Aki, saying, \u201cI would\n          like to make a pilgrimage to the Atago Shrine in Kyoto.\u201d Lord Aki\n          asked, \u201cFor what reason?\u201d and the messenger replied, \u201cSince Atago is\n          the god of archery, my intentions are for the sake of fortune in war.\u201d Lord Aki became angry and answered, \u201cThat is absolutely worthless!\n          Should the vanguard of the Nabeshimas be making requests to Atago? If\n          the incarnation of Atago were fighting on the enemy\u2019s side, the\n          vanguard should be equal to cutting him neatly in two.\u201d  D\u014dhaku lived in Kurotsuchibaru. His son was named Gorobei. Once when\n          Gorobei was carrying a load of rice, a r\u014dnin of Master Kumashiro\n          Saky\u014d\u2019s by the name of Iwamura Ky\u016bnai was coming from the other\n          direction. There was a grudge between the two of them from some former\n          incident, and now Gorobei struck Ky\u016bnai with his load of rice, started\n          an argument, beat him and pushed him into a ditch, and then returned\n          home. Ky\u016bnai yelled some threat at Gorobei and returned to his home\n          where he related this event to his older brother Gen\u2019emon. The two of\n          them then went off to Gorobei\u2019s to take revenge. When they got there, the door was open just a bit, and Gorobei was\n          waiting behind it with drawn sword. Not knowing this, Gen\u2019emon entered\n          and Gorobei struck at him with a sweep from the side. Having received\n          a deep wound, Gen\u2019emon used his sword as a staff and hobbled back\n          outside. Then Ky\u016bnai rushed in and struck at D\u014dhaku\u2019s son-in-law\n          Katsuemon, who was sitting by the hearth. His sword glanced off the\n          pot hanger, and he cut off half of Katsuemon\u2019s face. D\u014dhaku, together\n          with his wife, grabbed the sword away from Ky\u016bnai. Ky\u016bnai apologized and said, \u201cI have already achieved my purpose.\n          Please give me back my sword and I will accompany my brother home.\u201d\n          But when D\u014dhaku handed it back to him, Ky\u016bnai cut him once in the back\n          and severed his neck halfway through. He then crossed swords with\n          Gorobei again, and both went outside and fought an even match until he\n          cut off Gorobei\u2019s arm. At this point Ky\u016bnai, who also suffered many wounds, shouldered his\n          elder brother Gen\u2019emon and returned home. Gen\u2019emon, however, died on\n          the way back. Gorobei\u2019s wounds were numerous. Although he stopped the bleeding, he\n          died on account of drinking some water. D\u014dhaku\u2019s wife suffered some severed fingers. D\u014dhaku\u2019s wound was a\n          severed neck bone, and since only his throat remained intact, his head\n          hung down in front. Now boosting his head up with his own hands,\n          D\u014dhaku went off to the surgeon\u2019s. The surgeon\u2019s treatment was like this: first he rubbed a mixture of\n          pine resin and oil on D\u014dhaku\u2019s jaw and bound it in ramie. He then\n          attached a rope to the top of his head and tied it to a beam, sewed\n          the open wound shut, and buried his body in rice so that he would not\n          be able to move. D\u014dhaku never lost consciousness nor did he change from his everyday\n          attitude, nor did he even drink ginseng. It is said that only on the\n          third day, when there was a hemorrhage, did he use a little medicinal\n          stimulant. In the end, the bones mended, and he recovered without\n          incident.  When Lord Mitsushige contracted smallpox at Uenoseki, Ikushima Sakuan\n          gave him some medicine. It was an exceptionally heavy case of\n          smallpox, and his attendants both high and low were rather tense.\n          Suddenly his scabs turned black. The men who were nursing him lost\n          heart and secretly informed Sakuan, who came immediately. He said,\n          \u201cWell, this is something to be thankful for. The scabs are healing. He\n          should soon make a complete recovery with no complications. I give you\n          my guarantee.\u201d The people who were at Lord Mitsushige\u2019s side heard this and thought,\n          \u201cSakuan looks a little deranged. This has become all the more\n          hopeless.\u201d Sakuan then set folding screens around, came out after a while, and\n          fed Lord Mitsushige one packet of medicine. Very quickly the patient\u2019s\n          scabs healed, and he made a complete recovery. Sakuan later confided\n          to someone, \u201cI gave the master that one packet of medicine resolved\n          that, as I was undertaking this treatment alone, if he did not recover\n          I would quickly cut open my stomach and die with him.\u201d  When Nakano Takumi was dying, his whole house gathered and he said,\n          \u201cYou should understand that there are three conditions to the\n          resolution of a retainer. They are the condition of the master\u2019s will,\n          the condition of vitality, and the condition of one\u2019s death.\u201d  Once when a number of men had gathered on the platform of the inner\n          citadel of the castle, a certain man said to Uchida Sh\u014demon, \u201cIt is\n          said that you are a teacher of the sword, but judging by your everyday\n          attitude, your teaching must be very wild indeed. If you were\n          requested to perform kaishaku, I can imagine that instead of\n          cutting the neck you\u2019d probably cut the top of the man\u2019s head.\u201d Sh\u014demon rejoined, \u201cSuch is not the case. Draw a little ink spot on\n          your own neck, and I\u2019ll show you that I can cut without being off by a\n          hair.\u201d  Nagayama Rokur\u014dzaemon was going down the T\u014dkaid\u014d and was at Hamamatsu.\n          As he passed by an inn, a beggar faced his palanquin and said, \u201cI am a\n          r\u014dnin from Echigo. I am short of money and in difficulties. We are\n          both warriors. Please help me out.\u201d Rokur\u014dzaemon got angry and said, \u201cIt is a discourtesy to mention that\n          we are both warriors. If I were in your state of affairs, I\u2019d cut my\n          stomach open. Rather than being out of money for the road and exposing\n          yourself to shame, cut your stomach open right where you are!\u201d It is\n          said that the beggar moved off.  In Makiguchi Yohei\u2019s life he was kaishaku for many men. When a\n          certain Kanahara was to commit seppuku, Yohei consented to be\n          kaishaku. Kanahara thrust the sword into his belly, but at the\n          point of pulling it across he was unable to go further. Yohei\n          approached his side, yelled \u201cEi!\u201d and stamped his foot. From this\n          impetus, Kanahara was able to pull his sword straight across his\n          belly. After finishing the kaishaku, it is said that Yohei shed\n          tears and said, \u201cEven though he was formerly a good friend of mine. .\n          . .\u201d This is a story of Master Sukeemon\u2019s.  At the time of a certain person\u2019s seppuku, when the\n          kaishaku cut off his head, a little bit of skin was left\n          hanging and the head was not entirely separated from the body. The\n          official observer said, \u201cThere\u2019s some left.\u201d The kaishaku got\n          angry, took hold of the head, and cutting it completely off, held it\n          above eye level and said, \u201cTake a look!\u201d It is said that it was rather\n          chilling. This is a story of Master Sukeemon\u2019s. In the practice of past times, there were instances when the head flew\n          off. It was said that it is best to cut leaving a little skin\n          remaining so that it doesn\u2019t fly off in the direction of the verifying\n          officials. However, at present it is best to cut clean through. A man who had cut off fifty heads once said, \u201cAccording to the head,\n          there are cases when even the trunk of a body will bring some reaction\n          to you. Cutting off just three heads, at first there is no reaction\n          and you can cut well. But when you get to four or five, you feel quite\n          a bit of reaction. At any rate, since this is a very important matter,\n          if one always plans on bringing the head to the ground there should be\n          no mistakes.\u201d  When Lord Nabeshima Tsunashige was a child, Iwamura Kuranosuke was\n          ordered to the position of elder. On one occasion Kuranosuke saw that\n          there were gold coins before the young Tsunashige and asked the\n          attending retainer, \u201cFor what reason have you brought these out before\n          the young master?\u201d The attendant replied, \u201cThe master just now heard\n          that a gift had been brought for him. He said that he had not yet seen\n          it, so I brought it out for him.\u201d Kuranosuke scolded the man severely,\n          saying, \u201cTo place such base things before a person of importance is\n          the extremity of carelessness. You may also consider them something\n          not to be put before the lord\u2019s son. Attending retainers should\n          henceforth be very mindful of this.\u201d Another time, when Lord Tsunashige was about twenty years old, he once\n          went to the mansion at Naekiyama for some diversion. As the party\n          neared the mansion, he asked for a walking stick. His sandal carrier,\n          Miura Jibuzaemon, fashioned a stick and was about to give it to the\n          young lord. Kuranosuke saw this, quickly took the stick from\n          Jibuzaemon, and scolded him severely, saying, \u201cWill you make our\n          important young lord a sluggard? Even if he should ask for a stick, it\n          should not be given to him. This is carelessness on the part of the\n          attending retainer.\u201d Jibuzaemon was later promoted to the rank of teakiyari, and\n          Tsunetomo heard this story directly from him. When Shimomura Sh\u014dun was on service at the castle, Lord Naoshige said,\n          \u201cHow wonderful it is that Katsushige is so vigorous and powerful for\n          his age. In wrestling with his peers he even beat those who are older\n          than he is.\u201d Sh\u014dun replied, \u201cEven though I\u2019m an old man, I\u2019ll bet I\u2019m best at\n          seated wrestling.\u201d So saying, he jerked up Katsushige and threw him so\n          forcefully that it hurt. He then said, \u201cTo be prideful about your\n          strength while your mettle is not yet established is likely to bring\n          you shame in the midst of people. You are weaker than you look.\u201d Then\n          he withdrew.  At the time when Matsuda Yohei was an intimate friend of Ishii\n          Jinku\u2019s, there developed some bad feelings between the former and\n          Nozoe Jinbei. Yohei sent word to Jinbei saying, \u201cPlease come and I\n          will settle this matter once and for all.\u201d Then he and Jinku set out\n          together and, coming to the Yamabushi mansion at Kihara, they crossed\n          the only bridge there was and destroyed it. Talking over the\n          circumstances of the discord, they examined them from all sides and\n          found no reason to fight. But when they decided to turn around and go\n          home, there was, of course, no bridge. While they were looking for an appropriate way of crossing the moat,\n          the men whom the two had challenged could be seen approaching\n          stealthily. Yohei and Jinku saw this and said, \u201cWe have passed the\n          point of no return, and may as well fight rather than be disgraced at\n          a later date.\u201d The battle lasted for some time. Seriously wounded, Yohei fell down\n          between two fields. Jinbei also received a deep wound, and with blood\n          flowing into his eyes was unable to find Yohei. While Jinbei thus\n          searched about blindly, Yohei was able to hold him off from his prone\n          position and in the end cut him down. But when he attempted to deliver\n          the finishing blow, having no strength left in his hand, he pierced\n          Jinbei\u2019s neck by pushing the sword with his foot. At this point, friends arrived and accompanied Yohei back. After his\n          wounds healed he was ordered to commit seppuku. At that time he called\n          his friend Jinku, and they drank a farewell cup together.  \u014ckubo T\u014demon of Shioda ran a wineshop for Nabeshima Kenmotsu. Lord\n          Naomori, the son of Nabeshima Kai no kami, was a cripple and confined\n          indoors in a place called Mino. He harbored wrestlers and liked\n          rowdies. The wrestlers would often go to nearby villages and cause\n          disturbances. One time they went to T\u014demon\u2019s place, drank sake, and\n          talked unreasonably, bringing T\u014demon into an argument. He met them\n          with a halberd, but as there were two of them he was cut down. His son, Kannosuke, was fifteen years old and was in the midst of\n          studies at the J\u014dzeiji when he was informed of the incident. Galloping\n          off, he took a short sword about sixteen inches in length, joined\n          combat with the two big men, and in a short time finished them both\n          off. Although Kannosuke received thirteen wounds, he recovered. Later\n          he was called D\u014dko and is said to have become very adept at massage.  It is said that the late Tokunaga Kichizaemon repeatedly complained,\n          \u201cI\u2019ve grown so old that now, even if there were to be a battle, I\n          wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. Still, I would like to die by\n          galloping into the midst of the enemy and being struck down and\n          killed. It would be a shame to do nothing more than to die in one\u2019s\n          bed.\u201d It is said that the priest Gy\u014djaku heard this when he was an acolyte.\n          Gy\u014djaku\u2019s master was the priest Y\u014dmon, who was Kichizaemon\u2019s youngest\n          child.  When Sagara Ky\u016bma was requested to become a chief retainer, he said to\n          Nabeshima Heizaemon, \u201cFor some reason I have been increasingly well\n          treated by the master and now have been requested to take a high rank.\n          Not having a good retainer, my affairs are liable to be in disorder.\n          It is my request that you give me your retainer, Takase Jibuzaemon.\u201d\n          Heizaemon listened to him and consented, saying, \u201cIt is very\n          gratifying that you have kept an eye on my retainer. I will therefore\n          do as you ask.\u201d But when he related this to Jibuzaemon, the latter said, \u201cI should\n          reply directly to Master Ky\u016bma.\u201d He then went to Ky\u016bma\u2019s place and\n          talked with him. Jibuzaemon told Ky\u016bma, \u201cI know it is a great honor\n          that you have thought well of me and have made this request. But a\n          retainer is a person who cannot change masters. As you are of high\n          rank, if I were to become your retainer my life would be replete, but\n          that repleteness would be a vexation to me. Because Heizaemon is of\n          low rank and is hard pressed, we live by eating cheap rice gruel. Yet\n          that is sweet enough. Please think this over.\u201d Ky\u016bma was extremely impressed.  A certain man went off somewhere and on returning home late at night,\n          found that a strange man had slipped into the house and was committing\n          adultery with his wife. He thereupon killed the man. He then broke\n          down a wall and propped up a bale of rice, and by this arrangement\n          submitted to the authorities that he had killed a thief. Thus it went\n          without mishap. After some time had passed he divorced his wife and\n          the affair was finished.  When a certain person returned home from some place or other, he found\n          his wife committing adultery with a retainer in the bedroom. When he\n          drew near the two, his retainer fled through the kitchen. He then went\n          into the bedroom and slew his wife. Calling the maidservant, he explained what had happened and said,\n          \u201cBecause this would bring shame to the children, it should be covered\n          up as death by illness and I will need considerable help. If you think\n          that this is too much for you, I may as well kill you too for your\n          part in this serious crime.\u201d She replied, \u201cIf you will spare my life,\n          I will go on as if I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d She rearranged the room and\n          set out the corpse in its nightclothes. Then, after sending a man to the doctor\u2019s place two or three times\n          saying that there was a sudden illness, they sent a last messenger\n          saying that it was too late and there was no longer any need to come.\n          The wife\u2019s uncle was called in and told about the illness, and he was\n          convinced. The entire affair was passed off as death by illness, and\n          to the end no one knew the truth. At a later date the retainer was\n          dismissed. This affair happened in Edo.  At New Year\u2019s in the third year of Keich\u014d at a place in Korea called\n          Yolsan, when the armies of the Ming appeared by the hundreds of\n          thousands, the Japanese troops were amazed and watched with bated\n          breath. Lord Naoshige said, \u201cWell, well. That\u2019s a great number of men!\n          I wonder how many hundreds of thousands there are?\u201d Jin\u2019emon said, \u201cIn\n          Japan, for something that\u2019s numberless we say \u2018as many as the hairs on\n          a three-year-old calf.\u2019 This would certainly live up to the number of\n          hairs on a three-year-old calf!\u201d It is said that everybody laughed and\n          regained their spirits. Later, Lord Katsushige was hunting at Mt. Shiroishi and told Nakano\n          Matabei about this. \u201cExcept for your father who spoke in such a way,\n          there was no one who said even a word.\u201d  Nakano Jin\u2019emon constantly said, \u201cA person who serves when treated\n          kindly by the master is not a retainer. But one who serves when the\n          master is being heartless and unreasonable is a retainer. You should\n          understand this principle well.\u201d  When Yamamoto Jin\u2019emon was eighty years old, he became ill. At one\n          point, he seemed to be on the verge of groaning, and someone said to\n          him, \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better if you groan. Go ahead.\u201d But he replied,\n          \u201cSuch is not the case. The name of Yamamoto Jin\u2019emon is known by\n          everyone, and I have shown up well throughout a whole lifetime. To let\n          people hear my groaning voice in my last moments would never do.\u201d It\n          is said that he did not let out a groan to the very end.  A certain son of Mori Monbei got into a fight and returned home\n          wounded. Asked by Monbei, \u201cWhat did you do to your opponent?\u201d his son\n          replied, \u201cI cut him down.\u201d When Monbei asked, \u201cDid you deliver the\n          coup de grace?\u201d his son replied, \u201cIndeed I did.\u201d Then Monbei said, \u201cYou have certainly done well, and there is nothing\n          to regret. Now, even if you fled you would have to commit seppuku\n          anyway. When your mood improves, commit seppuku, and rather than die\n          by another\u2019s hand, you can die by your father\u2019s.\u201d And soon after he\n          performed\n          kaishaku for his son.  A man in the same group as Aiura Genzaemon committed some nefarious\n          deed, and so the group leader gave him a note, condemning him to\n          death, which was to be taken to Genzaemon\u2019s place. Genzaemon perused\n          the note and then said to the man, \u201cIt says here that I should kill\n          you, so I will do away with you on the eastern bank. Previously you\n          have practiced such things as swordsmanship. . . . Now fight with all\n          you\u2019ve got.\u201d The man replied, \u201cI will do as you say,\u201d and with\n          Genzaemon alone accompanying him, they left the house. They had gone about twenty yards along the edge of the moat when a\n          retainer of Genzaemon\u2019s yelled out \u201cHey, Hey!\u201d from the other side. As\n          Genzaemon was turning around, the condemned man attacked him with his\n          sword. Genzaemon ducked backwards, drew his sword, and cut the man\n          down. He then returned home. He put the clothes he had been wearing at that time into a chest and\n          locked them up, never showing them to anyone for the rest of his life.\n          After he died, the clothes were examined, and it was seen that they\n          were rent. This was told by his son, Genzaemon.  \u014ckubo D\u014dko is said to have remarked: Everyone says that no masters of the arts will appear as the world\n          comes to an end. This is something that I cannot claim to understand.\n          Plants such as peonies, azaleas, and camellias will be able to produce\n          beautiful flowers, end of the world or not. If men would give some\n          thought to this fact, they would understand. And if people took notice\n          of the masters of even these times, they would be able to say that\n          there are masters in the various arts. But people become imbued with\n          the idea that the world has come to an end and no longer put forth any\n          effort. This is a shame. There is no fault in the times.  While Fukahori Magoroku was still living as a dependent second son, he\n          once went hunting at Fukahori, and his retainer, mistaking him for a\n          wild boar in the darkness of the undergrowth, fired the rifle,\n          wounding him in the knee and causing him to fall from a great height.\n          The retainer, greatly upset, stripped himself to the waist and was\n          about to commit seppuku. Magoroku said, \u201cYou can cut your stomach open\n          later. I don\u2019t feel well, so bring me some water to drink.\u201d The\n          retainer ran about and obtained some water for his master to drink and\n          in the process calmed down. After that the retainer was again about to commit seppuku, but\n          Magoroku forcibly stopped him. Upon returning, they checked in with\n          the man on guard, and Magoroku asked his father, Kanzaemon, to forgive\n          the retainer. Kanzaemon said to the retainer, \u201cIt was an unexpected\n          mistake, so do not be worried. There is no need for reservation.\n          Continue with your work.\u201d  A man by the name of Takagi got into an argument with three farmers in\n          the neighborhood, was soundly beaten out in the fields, and returned\n          home. His wife said to him, \u201cHaven\u2019t you forgotten about the matter of\n          death?\u201d \u201cDefinitely not!\u201d he replied. His wife then retorted, \u201cAt any rate, a man dies only once. Of the\n          various ways of dying\u2014dying of disease, being cut down in battle,\n          seppuku, or being beheaded\u2014to die ignominiously would be a shame,\u201d and\n          went outside. She soon returned, carefully put the two children to\n          bed, prepared some torches, dressed herself for battle after\n          nightfall, and then said, \u201cWhen I went out to survey the scene a bit\n          earlier, it seemed that the three men went into one place for a\n          discussion. Now is the right time. Let\u2019s go quickly!\u201d So saying, they went out with the husband in the lead, burning torches\n          and wearing short swords. They broke into their opponents\u2019 place and\n          dispersed them, both husband and wife slashing about and killing two\n          of the men and wounding the other. The husband was later ordered to\n          commit seppuku. There was a certain retainer of Takeda Shingen\u2019s who started an\n          argument with a man, grappled him to the ground, thrashed him soundly,\n          and trampled on him until his companions ran up and pulled them apart.\n          The elders conferred over this and said, \u201cThe man who was trampled\n          should be punished.\u201d Shingen heard this and said, \u201cA fight is\n          something that goes to the finish. A man who forgets the Way of the\n          Samurai and does not use his sword will be forsaken by the gods and\n          Buddhas. As an example to subsequent retainers, both men should be\n          crucified.\u201d The men who had pulled them apart were banished.  In Yui Sh\u014dsetsu\u2019s military instructions, \u201cThe Way of the Three\n          Ultimates,\u201d there is a passage on the character of karma. He received\n          an oral teaching of about eighteen chapters concerning the Greater\n          Bravery and the Lesser Bravery. He neither wrote them down nor\n          committed them to memory, but rather forgot them completely. Then, in\n          facing real situations, he acted on impulse and the things that he had\n          learned became wisdom of his own. This is the character of karma.  When faced with a crisis, if one puts some spittle on his earlobe and\n          exhales deeply through his nose, he will overcome anything at hand.\n          This is a secret matter. Furthermore, when experiencing a rush of\n          blood to the head, if one puts spittle on the upper part of one\u2019s ear,\n          it will soon go away.  Tzu Ch\u2019an was on the point of death when someone asked him how to\n          govern the country. He replied: There is nothing that surpasses ruling with benevolence. However, to\n          put into practice enough benevolent governing to rule the country is\n          difficult. To do this lukewarmly will result in neglect. If governing\n          with benevolence is difficult, then it is best to govern strictly. To\n          govern strictly means to be strict before things have arisen, and to\n          do things in such a way that evil will not arise. To be strict after\n          the evil has arisen is like laying a snare. There are few people who\n          will make mistakes with fire after having once been burned. Of people\n          who regard water lightly, many have been drowned.  A certain man said, \u201cI know the shapes of Reason and of Woman.\u201d When\n          asked about this, he replied, \u201cReason is fourcornered and will not\n          move even in an extreme situation. Woman is round. One can say that\n          she does not distinguish between good and evil or right and wrong and\n          tumbles into any place at all.\u201d  The basic meaning of etiquette is to be quick at both the beginning\n          and end and tranquil in the middle. Mitani Senzaemon heard this and\n          said, \u201cThat\u2019s just like being a kaishaku.\u201d  Fukae Angen accompanied an acquaintance of his to the priest Tessh\u016b of\n          Osaka, and at first said privately to the priest, \u201cThis man aspires to\n          study Buddhism and hopes to receive your teaching. He is a man of\n          rather high determination.\u201d Soon after the interview the priest said, \u201cAngen is a man who does\n          harm to others. He said that this man is a good man, but wherein is\n          his goodness? There was no goodness visible to Tessh\u016b\u2019s eyes. It is\n          not a good idea to praise people carelessly. When praised, both wise\n          and foolish become prideful. To praise is to do harm.\u201d  When Hotta Kaga no kami Masamori was a page to the shogun, he was so\n          headstrong that the shogun wished to test what was at the bottom of\n          his heart. To do this, the shogun heated a pair of tongs and placed\n          them in the hearth. Masamori\u2019s custom was to go to the other side of\n          the hearth, take the tongs, and greet the master. This time, when he\n          unsuspectingly picked up the tongs, his hands were immediately burned.\n          As he did obeisance in his usual manner, however, the shogun quickly\n          got up and took the tongs from him.  A certain person said, \u201cWhen a castle is being surrendered, as long as\n          there are one or two men within it who are determined to hold on, the\n          defending forces will not be of one accord, and in the end no one will\n          hold the castle. \u201cIn the taking of the castle, if when the man who is to receive it\n          approaches and the one or two men who are determined to hold on to it\n          lightly fire on him from the shadows, the man will be alarmed and the\n          battle will be on. In such a case, even though it is unwillingly done,\n          the castle will have to be stormed. This is called being forced to\n          besiege a castle by those besieged.\u201d  The Buddhist priest Ry\u014dzan wrote down some generalities concerning\n          Takanobu\u2019s battles. A certain priest saw this and criticized him,\n          saying, \u201cIt is inappropriate for a priest to write about a military\n          commander. No matter how successful his writing style may be, since he\n          is not acquainted with military things, he is liable to be mistaken in\n          understanding a famous general\u2019s mind. It is irreverent to pass on\n          misconceptions concerning a famous general to later generations.\u201d  A certain person said, \u201cIn the Saint\u2019s mausoleum there is a poem that\n          goes: If in one\u2019s heart He follows the path of sincerity, Though he does not pray, Will not the gods protect him? What is this path of sincerity?\u201d A man answered him by saying, \u201cYou seem to like poetry. I will answer\n          you with a poem. As everything in the world is but a sham, Death is the only sincerity. It is said that becoming as a dead man in one\u2019s daily living is the\n          following of the path of sincerity.\u201d  If you cut a face lengthwise, urinate on it, and trample on it with\n          straw sandals, it is said that the skin will come off. This was heard\n          by the priest Gy\u014djaku when he was in Kyoto. It is information to be\n          treasured.  One of Matsudaira Sagami no kami\u2019s retainers went to Kyoto on a matter\n          of debt collection and took up lodgings by renting living quarters in\n          a townhouse. One day while standing out front watching the people go\n          by, he heard a passerby say, \u201cThey say that Lord Matsudaira\u2019s men are\n          involved in a fight right now.\u201d The retainer thought, \u201cHow worrisome\n          that some of my companions are involved in a fight. There are some men\n          to relieve those at Edo staying here. Perhaps these are the men\n          involved.\u201d He asked the passerby of the location, but when he arrived\n          out of breath, his companions had already been cut down and their\n          adversaries were at the point of delivering the coup de grace. He\n          quickly let out a yell, cut the two men down, and returned to his\n          lodgings. This matter was made known to an official of the shogunate, and the\n          man was called up before him and questioned. \u201cYou gave assistance in\n          your companions\u2019 fight and thus disregarded the government\u2019s\n          ordinance. This is true beyond a doubt, isn\u2019t it?\u201d The man replied, \u201cI am from the country, and it is difficult for me to\n          understand everything that Your Honor is saying. Would you please\n          repeat that?\u201d The official got angry and said, \u201cIs there something wrong with your\n          ears? Didn\u2019t you abet a fight, commit bloodshed, disregard the\n          government\u2019s ordinance, and break the law?\u201d The man then replied, \u201cI have at length understood what you are\n          saying. Although you say that I have broken the law and disregarded\n          the government\u2019s ordinance, I have by no means done so. The reason for\n          this is that all living things value their lives, and this goes\n          without saying for human beings. I, especially, value my life.\n          However, I thought that to hear a rumor that one\u2019s friends are\n          involved in a fight and to pretend not to hear this is not to preserve\n          the Way of the Samurai, so I ran to the place of action. To\n          shamelessly return home after seeing my friends struck down would\n          surely have lengthened my life, but this too would be disregarding the\n          Way. In preserving the Way, one will throw away his own precious life.\n          Thus, in order to preserve the Way of the Samurai and not to disregard\n          the Samurai Ordinances, I quickly threw away my life at that place. I\n          beg that you execute me immediately.\u201d The official was very impressed and later dismissed the matter,\n          communicating to Lord Matsudaira, \u201cYou have a very able samurai in\n          your service. Please treasure him.\u201d  This is among the sayings of the priest Bankei. \u201cNot to borrow the strength of another, nor to rely on one\u2019s own\n          strength; to cut off past and future thoughts, and not to live within\n          the everyday mind . . . then the Great Way is right before one\u2019s\n          eyes.\u201d  Lord S\u014dma\u2019s family genealogy, called the Chiken marokashi, was\n          the best in Japan. One year when his mansion suddenly caught fire and\n          was burning to the ground, Lord S\u014dma said, \u201cI feel no regret about the\n          house and all its furnishings, even if they burn to the very last\n          piece, because they are things that can be replaced later on. I only\n          regret that I was unable to take out the genealogy, which is my\n          family\u2019s most precious treasure.\u201d There was one samurai among those attending him who said, \u201cI will go\n          in and take it out.\u201d Lord S\u014dma and the others all laughed and said,\n          \u201cThe house is already engulfed in flames. How are you going to take it\n          out?\u201d Now this man had never been loquacious, nor had he been particularly\n          useful, but being a man who did things from beginning to end, he was\n          engaged as an attendant. At this point he said, \u201cI have never been of\n          use to my master because I\u2019m so careless, but I have lived resolved\n          that someday my life should be of use to him. This seems to be that\n          time.\u201d And he leapt into the flames. After the fire had been extinguished, the master said, \u201cLook for his\n          remains. What a pity!\u201d Looking everywhere, they found his burnt corpse\n          in the garden adjacent to the living quarters. When they turned it\n          over, blood flowed out of the stomach. The man had cut open his\n          stomach and placed the genealogy inside and it was not damaged at all.\n          From this time on it was called the \u201cBlood Genealogy.\u201d  According to a certain person\u2019s story, \u201cIn the tradition of the\n          I Ching, it is a mistake to think that it is something for\n          divination. Its essence is nondivination. This can be seen by the fact\n          that the Chinese character \u2018I\u2019 is read as \u2018change.\u2019 Although\n          one divines good fortune, if he does evil it will become bad fortune.\n          And although he divines bad fortune, if he does good it will become\n          good fortune. \u201cConfucius\u2019 saying, \u2018By setting myself to the task for many years and\n          in the end learning change [I], I should make no big mistakes,\u2019\n          is not a matter of learning the I Ching. It means by studying\n          the essence of change and conducting oneself for many years in the Way\n          of Good, one should make no mistakes.\u201d  Hirano Gonbei was one of the Men of Seven Spears who advanced straight\n          up the hill at the battle of Shizugatake. At a later date he was\n          invited to become one of Lord Ieyasu\u2019s\n          hatamoto. Once he was being entertained at Master Hosokawa\u2019s.\n          The master said, \u201cMaster Gonbei\u2019s bravery is not a hidden matter in\n          Japan. It is truly a shame that such a man of bravery has been placed\n          in a low rank such as you are in now. This must be contrary to your\n          wishes. If you were to become a retainer of mine, I would give you\n          half the domain.\u201d Giving no answer at all, Gonbei suddenly got up from his seat, went\n          out to the veranda, stood facing the house, and urinated. Then he\n          said, \u201cIf I were the master\u2019s retainer, it would never do to urinate\n          from here.\u201d  When the priest Daiy\u016b from Sansh\u016b was making a sick call at a certain\n          place, he was told, \u201cThe man has just now died.\u201d Daiy\u016b said, \u201cSuch a\n          thing shouldn\u2019t have happened at this time. Didn\u2019t this occur from\n          insufficient treatment? What a shame!\u201d Now the doctor happened to be there at that time and heard what was\n          said from the other side of the sh\u014dji. He got extraordinarily\n          angry and came out and said, \u201cI heard Your Reverence say that the man\n          died from insufficient treatment. Since I am a rather bungling doctor,\n          this is probably true. I have heard that a priest embodies the power\n          of the Buddhist Law. Let me see you bring this dead man back to life,\n          for without such evidence Buddhism is worthless.\u201d Daiy\u016b was put out by this, but he felt that it would be unpardonable\n          for a priest to put a blemish on Buddhism, so he said, \u201cI will indeed\n          show you how to bring his life back by prayer. Please wait a moment. I\n          must go prepare myself,\u201dand returned to the temple. Soon he came back\n          and sat in meditation next to the corpse. Pretty soon the dead man\n          began to breathe and then completely revived. It is said that he lived\n          on for another half a year. As this was something told directly to the\n          priest Tannen, there is nothing mistaken about it. When telling of the way he prayed, Daiy\u016b said, \u201cThis is something not\n          practiced in our sect, so I didn\u2019t know of any way of prayer. I simply\n          set my heart for the sake of the Buddhist Law, returned to the temple,\n          sharpened a short sword that had been given as an offering to the\n          temple, and put it in my robe. Then I faced the dead man and prayed,\n          \u2018If the strength of the Buddhist Law exists, come back to life\n          immediately.\u2019 Since I was thus committed, if he hadn\u2019t come back to\n          life, I was resolved to the point of cutting open my stomach and dying\n          embracing the corpse.\u201d  When Yamamoto Gor\u014dzaemon went to the priest Tetsugy\u016b in Edo wanting to\n          hear something about Buddhism, Tetsugy\u016b said, \u201cBuddhism gets rid of\n          the discriminating mind. It is nothing more than this. I can give you\n          an illustration in terms of the warrior. The Chinese character for\n          \u201ccowardice\u201d  According to what one of the elders said, taking an enemy on the\n          battlefield is like a hawk taking a bird. Even though it enters into\n          the midst of a thousand of them, it gives no attention to any bird\n          other than the one that it has first marked. Moreover, what is called a kezuke no kubi is a head that one\n          has taken after having made the declaration, \u201cI will take that warrior\n          wearing such and such armor.\u201d  In the K\u014dy\u014dgunkan one person said, \u201cWhen facing the enemy, I\n          feel as if I have just entered darkness. Because of this I get heavily\n          wounded. Although you have fought with many famous men, you have never\n          been wounded. Why is that?\u201d The other man answered, \u201cWhen I have faced the enemy, of course it is\n          like being in the dark. But if at that time I tranquilize my mind, it\n          becomes like a night lit by a pale moon. If I begin my attack from\n          that point, I feel as though I will not be wounded.\u201d This is the\n          situation at the moment of truth.  A rifle ball hitting the water will ricochet. It is said that if one\n          marks it with a knife or dents it with his teeth, it will pass through\n          the water. Moreover, when the master is hunting or some such thing, if\n          one marks the ball with a sign, it will come in handy in case of a\n          mishap.  When Master Owari, Master Kii, and Master Mito were around the age of\n          ten, one day Lord Ieyasu was with them in the garden and knocked down\n          a big wasps\u2019 nest. A great number of wasps flew out, and Master Owari\n          and Master Kii were frightened and ran away. But Master Mito picked\n          off the wasps that were on his face, threw them away one by one, and\n          did not run away. Another time, when Lord Ieyasu was roasting a great number of\n          chestnuts in a large hearth, he invited the boys to join him. When the\n          chestnuts got sufficiently hot, they all started to pop out at once.\n          Two of the boys were frightened and moved away. Master Mito, however,\n          not the least bit frightened, picked up the ones that had popped out\n          and threw them back into the hearth.  In order to study medicine Eguchi T\u014dan went to old Yoshida Ichian\u2019s\n          place in the Banch\u014d area of Edo. At that time, there was in the\n          neighborhood a teacher of swordsmanship, to whom he used to go for\n          training from time to time. There was a r\u014dnin pupil there who one day\n          came up to T\u014dan and said as a parting remark, \u201cI am now going to\n          realize a long-cherished ambition, one I have had for many years. I am\n          informing you of this because you have always been friendly to me.\u201d\n          Then he walked away. T\u014dan felt uneasy about this, and when he followed\n          him, he could see a man wearing a braided hat coming from the opposite\n          direction. Now the sword teacher was about eight or ten yards ahead of the r\u014dnin,\n          and in passing by the man with the hat he soundly struck the man\u2019s\n          scabbard with his own. When the man looked around, the r\u014dnin knocked\n          off the man\u2019s hat and announced in a loud voice that his purpose was\n          revenge. With the man\u2019s attention being distracted by the confusion,\n          he was easily cut down. A tremendous amount of congratulations came\n          from the nearby mansions and townhouses. It is said that they even\n          brought out money for him. This was a favorite story of T\u014dan\u2019s.  Once when the priest Ungo of Matsushima was passing through the\n          mountains at night, he was set upon by mountain bandits. Ungo said, \u201cI\n          am a man of this area, not a pilgrim. I have no money at all, but you\n          can have these clothes if you like. Please spare my life.\u201d The bandits\n          said, \u201cWell, our efforts have been in vain. We don\u2019t need anything\n          like clothes,\u201d and passed on. They had gone about two hundred yards when Ungo turned back and called\n          to them, \u201cI have broken the commandment against lying. In my confusion\n          I forgot that I had one piece of silver in my moneybag. I am truly\n          regretful I said that I had nothing at all. I have it here now, so\n          please take it.\u201d The mountain bandits were deeply impressed, cut off\n          their hair right there, and became his disciples.  In Edo, four or five hatamoto gathered together one night for a\n          game of go. At one point one of them got up to go to the\n          toilet, and while he was gone an argument broke out. One man was cut\n          down, the lights were extinguished, and the place was in an uproar.\n          When the man came running back, he yelled, \u201cEverybody calm down! This\n          is really over nothing at all. Put the lamps back on and let me handle\n          this.\u201d After the lamps had been relighted and everyone had calmed down, the\n          man suddenly struck off the head of the other man involved in the\n          argument. He then said, \u201cMy luck as a samurai having run out, I was\n          not present at the fight. If this were seen as cowardice, I would be\n          ordered to commit seppuku. Even if that didn\u2019t happen, I would have no\n          excuse if it were said that I had fled to the toilet, and I would\n          still have no recourse other than seppuku. I have done this thing\n          because I thought I would die having cut down an adversary rather than\n          die having shamed myself alone.\u201d When the shogun heard of this matter, he praised the man.  Once a group of ten blind masseuses were traveling together in the\n          mountains, and when they began to pass along the top of a precipice,\n          they all became very cautious, their legs shook, and they were in\n          general struck with terror. Just then, the leading man stumbled and\n          fell off the cliff. Those that were left all wailed, \u201cAhh, ahh! How\n          piteous!\u201d But the masseuse who had fallen yelled up from below, \u201cDon\u2019t be\n          afraid. Although I fell, it was nothing. I am now rather at ease.\n          Before falling I kept thinking \u2018What will I do if I fall?\u2019 and there\n          was no end to my anxiety. But now I\u2019ve settled down. If the rest of\n          you want to be at ease, fall quickly!\u201d  H\u014dj\u014d Awa no kami once gathered together his disciples in the martial\n          arts and called in a physiognomist, who was popular in Edo at the\n          time, to have him determine whether they were brave men or cowards. He\n          had them see the man one by one, telling them, \u201cIf he determines\n          \u2018bravery,\u2019 you should strive all the more. If it is \u2018cowardice,\u2019 you\n          should strive by throwing away your life. It\u2019s something that you\u2019re\n          born with, so there\u2019s no shame in it.\u201d Hirose Denzaemon was then about twelve or thirteen years old. When he\n          sat down in front of the physiognomist, he said in a bristling voice,\n          \u201cIf you read cowardice in me I\u2019ll cut you down with a single\n          blow!\u201d  When there is something to be said, it is better if it is said right\n          away. If it is said later, it will sound like an excuse. Moreover, it\n          is occasionally good to really overwhelm your opponent. Also, in\n          addition to having spoken sufficiently, it is the highest sort of\n          victory to teach your opponent something that will be to his benefit.\n          This is in accordance with the Way.  The priest Ry\u014di said: The samurai of old were mortified by the idea of dying in bed; they\n          hoped only to die on the battlefield. A priest, too, will be unable to\n          fulfill the Way unless he is of this disposition. The man who shuts\n          himself away and avoids the company of men is a coward. Only evil\n          thoughts allow one to imagine that something good can be done by\n          shutting oneself away. For even if one does some good thing by\n          shutting himself away, he will be unable to keep the way open for\n          future generations by promulgating the clan traditions.  Takeda Shingen\u2019s retainer, Amari Bizen no kami, was killed in action\n          and his son, T\u014dz\u014d, at the age of eighteen took over his father\u2019s\n          position as an armed horseman attached to a general. Once a certain\n          man in his group received a deep wound, and since the blood would not\n          clot, T\u014dz\u014d ordered him to drink the feces of a redhaired horse mixed\n          with water. The wounded man said, \u201cLife is dear to me. How can I drink\n          horse feces?\u201d T\u014dz\u014d heard this and said, \u201cWhat an admirably brave warrior! What you\n          say is reasonable. However, the basic meaning of loyalty requires us\n          to preserve our lives and gain victory for our master on the\n          battlefield. Well, then, I\u2019ll drink some for you.\u201d Then he drank some\n          himself and handed over the cup to the man who took the medicine\n          gratefully and recovered. In the \u201cNotes on Martial Laws\u201d it is written that: The phrase, \u201cWin first, fight later,\u201d can be summed up in the two\n          words, \u201cWin beforehand.\u201d The resourcefulness of times of peace is the\n          military preparation for times of war. With five hundred allies one\n          can defeat an enemy force of ten thousand. When advancing on the enemy\u2019s castle and then pulling back, do not\n          retreat by the main road, but rather by the side roads. One should lay one\u2019s dead and wounded allies face down in the\n          direction of the enemy. It is a matter of course that a warrior\u2019s attitude should be to be in\n          the vanguard during an attack and in the rear during a retreat. In\n          approaching for the attack he does not forget to wait for the right\n          moment. In waiting for the right moment he never forgets the attack.  A helmet is usually thought to be very heavy, but when one is\n          attacking a castle or something similar, and arrows, bullets, large\n          rocks, great pieces of wood and the like are coming down, it will not\n          seem the least bit so.  Once when Master Yagy\u016b Tajima no kami Munenori was before the shogun\n          on some business, a number of bamboo swords fell from the ceiling. He\n          quickly clasped his hands above his head and was not struck. Again, at a certain time when he was summoned, the shogun was waiting\n          behind cover with a bamboo sword ready to strike him. Master Yagy\u016b\n          called out in a loud voice, \u201cThis is for your own discipline. Don\u2019t\n          look!\u201d As the shogun turned around, Master Yagy\u016b stepped up and took\n          the sword out of his hand.  A person who does not want to be struck by the enemy\u2019s arrows will\n          have no divine protection. For a man who does not wish to be hit by\n          the arrows of a common soldier, but rather by those of a warrior of\n          fame, there will be the protection for which he has asked.  Wind-bells are things that are used during campaigns in order to know\n          the direction of the wind. For night attacks, fire can be set windward\n          while the attack can be carried out from the opposite direction. Your\n          allies should be mindful of this also. One should always hang\n          wind-bells in order to know the direction of the wind.  Lord Aki declared that he would not have his descendants learn\n          military tactics. He said, \u201cOn the battlefield, once discretion starts\n          it cannot be stopped. One will not break through to the enemy with\n          discretion. Indiscretion is most important when in front of the\n          tiger\u2019s den. Therefore, if one were informed of military tactics, he\n          would have many doubts, and there would be no end to the matter. My\n          descendants will not practice military tactics.\u201d  According to Lord Naoshige\u2019s words: There is something to which every young samurai should pay attention.\n          During times of peace when listening to stories of battle, one should\n          never say, \u201cIn facing such a situation, what would a person do?\u201d Such\n          words are out of the question. How will a man who has doubts even in\n          his own room achieve anything on the battlefield? There is a saying that goes, \u201cNo matter what the circumstances might\n          be, one should be of the mind to win. One should be holding the first\n          spear to strike.\u201d Even though you have put your life on the line,\n          there is nothing to be done when the situation doesn\u2019t go as planned.  Takeda Shingen once said, \u201cIf there was a man who could kill Lord\n          Ieyasu, I would give him a handsome reward.\u201d Hearing this, a boy of\n          thirteen entered into the service of Lord Ieyasu and one night when he\n          saw that Ieyasu had retired, took a stab at his bedding. Lord Ieyasu\n          was actually in the next room silently reading a sutra, but he quickly\n          grabbed the boy. When the investigation was held, the boy related the facts honestly,\n          and Lord Ieyasu said, \u201cYou seemed to be an excellent young man, so I\n          employed you on friendly terms. Now, however, I am even more impressed\n          by you.\u201d He then sent the lad back to Shingen.  One night some samurai from Karatsu gathered together and were playing\n          go. Master Kitabatake was watching the game, and when he\n          offered a suggestion, one man attacked him with a sword. After the\n          people around them had stopped the man, Master Kitabatake pinched out\n          the light of the candle and said, \u201cIt was nothing more than my own\n          indiscretion, and I apologize. The sword hit the go case; I was\n          not the least bit wounded.\u201d Then the candle was relighted, but when the man came to reconciliate\n          and offer him a sake cup, Kitabatake cut the man\u2019s head off with one\n          blow. Presently he said, \u201cMy thigh having been cut through, it was\n          difficult to offer any resistance, but by binding my leg with my coat\n          and supporting myself with the go board, I have done this\n          thing.\u201d Having said this, he expired.  There is nothing so painful as regret. We would all like to be without\n          it. However, when we are very happy and become elated, or when we\n          habitually jump into something thoughtlessly, later we are distraught,\n          and it is for the most part because we did not think ahead and are now\n          regretful. Certainly we should try not to become dejected, and when\n          very happy should calm our minds.  These are teachings of the late Yamamoto Jin\u2019emon: Singlemindedness is all-powerful. Tether even a roasted chicken. Continue to spur a running horse. A man who will criticize you openly carries no connivance. A man exists for a generation, but his name lasts to the end of time. Money is a thing that will be there when asked for. A good man is not\n          so easily found. Walk with a real man one hundred yards and he\u2019ll tell you at least\n          seven lies. To ask when you already know is politeness. To ask when you don\u2019t know\n          is the rule. Wrap your intentions in needles of pine. One should not open his mouth wide or yawn in front of another. Do\n          this behind your fan or sleeve. A straw hat or helmet should be worn tilted toward the front.  It is a principle of the art of war that one should simply lay down\n          his life and strike. If one\u2019s opponent also does the same, it is an\n          even match. Defeating one\u2019s opponent is then a matter of faith and\n          destiny. One should not show his sleeping quarters to other people. The times\n          of deep sleep and dawning are very important. One should be mindful of\n          this. This is from a story by Nagahama Inosuke.  When one departs for the front, he should carry rice in a bag. His\n          underwear should be made from the skin of a badger. This way he will\n          not have lice. In a long campaign, lice are troublesome. When meeting with the enemy, there is a way to determine his strength.\n          If he has his head cast down, he will appear black and is strong. If\n          he is looking upward, he will appear white and is weak. This is from a\n          story by Natsume Toneri.  If a warrior is not unattached to life and death, he will be of no use\n          whatsoever. The saying that \u201cAll abilities come from one mind\u201d sounds\n          as though it has to do with sentient matters, but it is in fact a\n          matter of being unattached to life and death. With such nonattachment\n          one can accomplish any feat. Martial arts and the like are related to\n          this insofar as they can lead to the Way.  To calm one\u2019s mind, one swallows his saliva. This is a secret matter.\n          When one becomes angry, it is the same. Putting spittle on one\u2019s\n          forehead is also good. In the Yoshida school of archery, swallowing\n          one\u2019s spittle is the secret principle of the art.  A certain general said, \u201cFor soldiers other than officers, if they\n          would test their armor, they should test only the front. Furthermore,\n          while ornamentation on armor is unnecessary, one should be very\n          careful about the appearance of his helmet. It is something that\n          accompanies his head to the enemy\u2019s camp.\u201d  Nakano Jin\u2019emon said, \u201cLearning such things as military tactics is\n          useless. If one does not strike out by simply closing his eyes and\n          rushing into the enemy, even if it is only one step, he will be of no\n          use.\u201d This was also the opinion of Iyanaga Sasuke.  In Natsume Toneri\u2019s \u201cMilitary Stories\u201d it is written: \u201cLook at the\n          soldiers of recent times! Even in long battles there are hardly one or\n          two occasions when blood is washed with blood. One should not be\n          negligent.\u201d Toneri was a r\u014dnin from the Kamigata area.  To have execution grounds in a place where travelers come and go is\n          useless. The executions in Edo and the Kamigata area are meant to be\n          an example for the whole country. But the executions in one province\n          are only for an example in that province. If crimes are many, it is a\n          province\u2019s shame. How would this look to other provinces? With the passing of time, the criminal will forget the reason for his\n          crime; it is best to execute him on the spot.  Matsudaira Izu no kami said to Master Mizuno Kenmotsu, \u201cYou\u2019re such a\n          useful person, it\u2019s a shame that you\u2019re so short.\u201d Kenmotsu replied, \u201cThat\u2019s true. Sometimes things in this world don\u2019t\n          go the way we would like. Now if I were to cut off your head and\n          attach it to the bottom of my feet, I would be taller. But that\u2019s\n          something that couldn\u2019t be done.\u201d  A certain person was passing by the town of Yae when suddenly his\n          stomach began to hurt. He stopped at a house on a side street and\n          asked to use the toilet. There was only a young woman there, but she\n          took him to the back and showed him where it was. Just as he was\n          taking off his\n          hakama and going into the toilet, the woman\u2019s husband came home\n          and accused them both of adultery. In the end, it became a public\n          matter. Lord Naoshige heard the case and said, \u201cEven if this is not a matter\n          of adultery, it is the same as adultery to take off one\u2019s\n          hakama without hesitation in a place where there is an\n          unaccompanied woman, and in the woman\u2019s case to allow someone to\n          disrobe while her husband is absent from home.\u201d It is said that they were both condemned to death for this act.  In assessing the enemy\u2019s castle, there is a saying that goes, \u201cSmoke\n          and mist are like looking at a spring mountain. After the rain is like\n          viewing a clear day.\u201d There is weakness in perfect clarity.  Among the words spoken by great generals, there are some that were\n          said offhandedly. One should not receive these words in the same\n          manner, however.  People who have an intelligent appearance will not be outstanding even\n          if they do something good, and if they do something normal, people\n          will think them lacking. But if a person who is thought of as having a\n          gentle disposition does even a slightly good thing, he will be praised\n          by people.  On the fourteenth day of the seventh month in the third year of\n          Sh\u014dtoku, there were some cooks in the midst of preparations for the\n          Bon Festival in the outer citadel of the castle. One of them, Hara\n          J\u016br\u014demon, unsheathed his sword and cut off the head of Sagara\n          Genzaemon. Mawatari Rokuemon, Aiura Tarobei, Koga Kinbei, and Kakihara\n          Riemon all ran away in confusion. When J\u016br\u014demon sighted Kinbei and\n          started chasing him, the latter fled to the foot soldiers\u2019 gathering\n          area. There, the daimy\u014d\u2019s palanquin attendant, Tanaka Takeemon, stood\n          against J\u016br\u014demon and took away his still drawn sword. Ishimaru\n          San\u2019emon chased J\u016br\u014demon, and when they came to the foot soldiers\u2019\n          area, assisted Takeemon. The punishment was given on the twenty-fifth day of the eleventh month\n          in the same year. J\u016br\u014demon was bound with rope and beheaded. Rokuemon,\n          Tarobei, Kinbei, and Riemon were banished, and San\u2019emon was ordered to\n          retire. Takeemon was rewarded with three pieces of silver. It was later said that Takeemon had been slow to act, for he had not\n          bound the man at that time.  Among Takeda Shingen\u2019s retainers there were men of matchless courage,\n          but when Katsuyori was killed in the fight at Tenmokuzan, they all\n          fled. Tsuchiya S\u014dz\u014d, a warrior who had been in disfavor for many\n          years, came out alone, however, and said, \u201cI wonder where all the men\n          are who spoke so bravely every day? I shall return the master\u2019s favors\n          to me.\u201d And he fell alone in battle.  The essentials of speaking are in not speaking at all. If you think\n          that you can finish something without speaking, finish it without\n          saying a single word. If there is something that cannot be\n          accomplished without speaking, one should speak with few words, in a\n          way that will accord well with reason. To open one\u2019s mouth indiscriminately brings shame, and there are many\n          times when people will turn their backs on such a person.  A devotee of the Nembutsu recites the Buddha\u2019s name with every\n          incoming and outgoing breath in order never to forget the Buddha. A\n          retainer, too, should be just like this in thinking of his master. Not\n          to forget one\u2019s master is the most fundamental thing for a retainer.  Men who did well at the time of their death were men of real bravery.\n          There are many examples of such. But people who talk in an\n          accomplished fashion every day yet are agitated at the time of their\n          death can be known not to have true bravery.  In the secret principles of Yagy\u016b Tajima no kami Munenori there is the\n          saying, \u201cThere are no military tactics for a man of great strength.\u201d\n          As proof of this, there was once a certain vassal of the shogun who\n          came to Master Yagy\u016b and asked to become a disciple. Master Yagy\u016b\n          said, \u201cYou seem to be a man who is very accomplished in some school of\n          martial art. Let us make the master-disciple contract after I learn\n          the name of the school.\u201d But the man replied, \u201cI have never practiced one of the martial arts.\u201d Master Yagy\u016b said, \u201cHave you come to make sport of Tajima no kami? Is\n          my perception amiss in thinking that you are a teacher to the shogun?\u201d\n          But the man swore to it and Master Yagy\u016b then asked, \u201cThat being so,\n          do you not have some deep conviction?\u201d The man replied, \u201cWhen I was a child, I once became suddenly aware\n          that a warrior is a man who does not hold his life in regret. Since I\n          have held that in my heart for many years, it has become a deep\n          conviction, and today I never think about death. Other than that I\n          have no special conviction.\u201d Master Yagy\u016b was deeply impressed and said, \u201cMy perceptions were not\n          the least bit awry. The deepest principle of my military tactics is\n          just that one thing. Up until now, among all the many hundreds of\n          disciples I have had, there is not one who is licensed in this deepest\n          principle. It is not necessary for you to take up the wooden sword. I\n          will initiate you right now.\u201d And it is said that he promptly handed\n          him the certified scroll. This is a story of Murakawa S\u014dden\u2019s.  Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day\n          when one\u2019s body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being\n          ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears and swords, being carried away\n          by surging waves, being thrown into the midst of a great fire, being\n          struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake,\n          falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease, or committing\n          seppuku at the death of one\u2019s master. And every day without fail one\n          should consider himself as dead. There is a saying of the elders that goes, \u201cStep from under the eaves\n          and you\u2019re a dead man. Leave the gate and the enemy is waiting.\u201d This\n          is not a matter of being careful. It is to consider oneself as dead\n          beforehand.  People will become your enemies if you become eminent too quickly in\n          life, and you will be ineffectual. Rising slowly in the world, people\n          will be your allies and your happiness will be assured. In the long run, whether you are fast or slow, as long as you have\n          people\u2019s understanding there will be no danger. It is said that\n          fortune that is urged upon you from others is the most effective.  The warriors of old cultivated mustaches, for as proof that a man had\n          been slain in battle, his ears and nose would be cut off and brought\n          to the enemy\u2019s camp. So that there would be no mistake as to whether\n          the person was a man or a woman, the mustache was also cut off with\n          the nose. At such a time the head was thrown away if it had no\n          mustache, for it might be mistaken for that of a woman. Therefore,\n          growing a mustache was one of the disciplines of a samurai so that his\n          head would not be thrown away upon his death. Tsunetomo said, \u201cIf one washes his face with water every morning, if\n          he is slain his complexion will not change.\u201d  The word \u201cperson of the north\u201d comes from a tradition of the correct\n          way of upbringing. A couple will put their pillows in the west, and\n          the man, lying on the south side, will face the north, while the\n          woman, lying on the north side, will face the south.  In bringing up a boy, one should first encourage a sense of valor.\n          From the time he is young the child should liken his parents to the\n          master, and learn everyday politeness and etiquette, the serving of\n          other people, the ways of speech, forbearance and even the correct way\n          of walking down the street. The elders were taught in the same\n          fashion. When he does not put effort into things, he should be scolded\n          and made to go the entire day without eating. This is also one of the\n          disciplines of a retainer. As for a girl, it is most important to teach her chastity from the\n          time she is a child. She should not be in the company of a man at a\n          distance of less than six feet, nor should she meet them eye to eye,\n          nor should she receive things from them directly from hand to hand.\n          Neither should she go sightseeing or take trips to temples. A woman\n          who has been brought up strictly and has endured suffering at her own\n          home will suffer no ennui after she is married. In dealing with menials, one should use rewards and punishments. If\n          one is lax in being sure that they do as they are told, menials will\n          become self-interested and will later be involved in wrongdoings. It\n          is something about which one should be very careful. As a retainer of the Nabeshima clan, one should have the intention of\n          studying our province\u2019s history and traditions, but provincial studies\n          are made light of nowadays. The basic reason for this study is to\n          understand the foundation of our clan, and to know that the clan\u2019s\n          forefathers established its perpetuity by means of their suffering and\n          compassion. The fact that our clan has perpetually continued in an\n          unrivaled manner up to this very day is due to the humanity and\n          martial valor of Master Ry\u016bz\u014dji Iekane, the charity and faith of\n          Master Nabeshima Kiyohisa, and the appearance of Lord Ry\u016bz\u014dji Takanobu\n          and Lord Nabeshima Naoshige and their might. I am at a complete loss when it comes to understanding why people of\n          this generation have forgotten these things and respect the Buddhas of\n          other places. Neither the Shakyamuni Buddha, nor Confucius, nor\n          Kusunoki, nor Shingen were ever retainers of the Ry\u016bz\u014djis or the\n          Nabeshimas; hence it cannot be said that they are in harmony with our\n          clan\u2019s customs. In times of war or in times of peace it would be\n          sufficient if both the upper and lower classes would worship our\n          ancestors and study their teachings. One worships the head of whatever\n          clan or discipline to which he belongs. Outside learning for retainers\n          of our clan is worthless. One may think that it is fine to study other\n          disciplines as a diversion after his provincial studies are replete.\n          Yet if a person has a good understanding of provincial studies, he\n          will see that there is nothing lacking in them. Today, if someone from another clan were to ask about the origin of\n          the Ry\u016bz\u014djis and the Nabeshimas, or why the fief was transferred from\n          the former to the latter, or if they were to ask something like, \u201cI\n          have heard that the Ry\u016bz\u014djis and the Nabeshimas are the greatest in\n          Kyushu for deeds of martial valor, but can you tell me some of the\n          particulars?\u201d I suppose that the man with no knowledge of provincial\n          studies would not be able to answer a word. For a retainer there should be nothing other than doing his own job.\n          For the most part people dislike their own jobs, find those of others\n          more interesting, cause misunderstanding, and bring on utter\n          disasters. Good models of men who performed their duty in their work\n          are Lord Naoshige and Lord Katsushige. The retainers of those times\n          all performed their duties. From the upper classes, men who would be\n          of good use were searched out, while from the lower classes men\n          desired to be useful. The minds of the two classes were of mutual\n          accord, and the strength of the clan was secure. In all our generations of masters there has never been a bad or\n          foolish one, and in the end there has never been one who ranked second\n          or third among the daimy\u014d of Japan. It is truly a wonderful clan; this\n          is due to the faith of its founders. Moreover, they did not send the\n          clan\u2019s retainers to other provinces, nor did they invite men from\n          other provinces in. Men who were made r\u014dnin were kept within the\n          province, as were the descendants of those who were made to commit\n          seppuku. The wonder of being born into a clan with such a deep pledge\n          between master and servant is an inexpressible blessing, passed down\n          through the ages, for both farmer and townsman. This goes without\n          saying for the retainer. The foundation of a Nabeshima samurai should be in knowing this fact;\n          in being deeply resolved to return this blessing by being useful; in\n          serving more and more selflessly when treated kindly by the master; in\n          knowing that being made a r\u014dnin or being ordered to commit seppuku are\n          also forms of service; and in aiming to be mindful of the clan\n          forever, whether one is banished deep in the mountains or buried under\n          the earth. Although it is unfitting for someone like me to say this,\n          in dying it is my hope not to become a Buddha. Rather, my will is\n          permeated with the resolution to help manage the affairs of the\n          province, though I be reborn as a Nabeshima samurai seven times. One\n          needs neither vitality nor talent. In a word, it is a matter of having\n          the will to shoulder the clan by oneself. How can one human being be inferior to another? In all matters of\n          discipline, one will be useless unless he has great pride. Unless one\n          is determined to move the clan by himself, all his discipline will\n          come to naught. Although, like a tea kettle, it is easy for one\u2019s\n          enthusiasm to cool, there is a way to keep this from happening. My own\n          vows are the following: Never to be outdone in the Way of the Samurai. To be of good use to the master. To be filial to my parents. To manifest great compassion, and to act for the sake of Man. If one dedicates these four vows to the gods and Buddhas every\n          morning, he will have the strength of two men and will never slip\n          backward. One must edge forward like the inchworm, bit by bit. The\n          gods and Buddhas, too, first started with a vow.", "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/stock-watch/stock-market-update-power-stocks-down-as-market-falls/articleshow/121339879.cms": "Getty Images India 10-year bond yield rose 0.05 per cent to 6.03 after trading in 6.02-6.04 range.

Hinduja, Chairman, IIHL, which is the promoter of IndusInd Bank.

Most brokerages see downside in shares of IndusInd Bank, which posted a net loss of Rs 2,329 crore, marking one of the worst quarters in terms of both financial metrics and top level upheavals in the wake of accounting (derivative, MFI, other assets/liabilities) fraud. Brokerage firm Emkay in its note said: \u201cWe believe these developments could hurt the bank\u2019s business and financials in the near-to-medium term.\u201d Nirmal Bang, taking note of \u201cuncertain outlook on various parameters\u201d, has cut the bank\u2019s earnings estimates by 23.6 per cent in current fiscal and 13 per cent for FY\u201927. Lapses in derivatives accounting, slippages in microfinance portfolio, and fraud in balance sheet disclosures have rattled the private sector bank in the March quarter. The bank\u2019s internal audit review has found \u201cinvolvement of senior Bank officials, including former Key Management Personnel (KMP), in overriding key internal controls\u201d. The bank has reported likely involvement of the senior management in the accounting fraud to the central government. IndusInd Bank Board is expected to submit names to the RBI for a new MD by June 30. \u201cWe believe that given the series and intensity of frauds, the RBI may possibly consider appointing a nominee director on the Board and even push for a PSB banker as the MD, as has been seen in other beleaguered banks. Even in the event of a private banker being onboarded, as the new MD they will be faced with the uphill task of resurrecting the bank and regaining customer/investor trust,\u201d Emkay said. Nuvama Institutional Equities in its note said the new CEO will have to tighten internal controls, strengthen governance and likely rebalance the asset mix, implying a sharp slowdown in earnings growth for next two years. \u201cEvery other bank that has gone through accounting discrepancies or prior-period adjustments has taken 3\u20134 years to achieve a new normal. IndusInd, being a large bank, could take less time. Also, how retail depositors behave in the short term after back-to-back disclosures of prior-period adjustments is unknown,\u201d Nuvama said. In January, the bank\u2019s CFO Gobind Jain resigned. On April 29, CEO Sumant Kathpalia and Deputy CEO Arun Khurana resigned from the bank, following which IndusInd Board appointed a Committee of Executives to oversee the operations of the bank, till a new MD and CEO assumes charge ICICI Securities in its note said it believes IndusInd Bank would prioritise balance sheet stability vs. growth while the path to RoA revival remains uncertain, even if it was to get a signature hire. \u201cWe expect a sharp EPS (earnings per share) downgrade in consensus estimates,\u201d ICICI Securities said, while retaining its \u2018sell\u2019 rating on the bank with a target price of Rs 650. IDBI Capital has downgraded the scrip to \u2018sell\u2019 rating with a new target price of Rs 680. Even after a dismal March quarter results, IndusInd Bank shares on Thursday afternoon bounced back after falling nearly 6 per cent in early trade.

We cut FY26-27 est. by 40% as we adjust for the inflated base profitability Rating downgrade due to path to 1% ROA now long drawn and business uncertainty The next event to monitor is the recommendation of new CEO by the Board to the RBI by 30th June ICICI Sec on IndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs650 Reports loss with weak core NIM/PPOP; growth/RoA revival yet uncertain Core profitability, adjusted for one-offs, was weak too with NIM at 3.47% (down 46bps QoQ) while PPOP slipped 24% YoY to INR 30.62bn. CET 1 and LCR levels are comfortable at 15.1% and 118%, respectively. The board is yet to recommend a name for its MD&CEO position to the RBI. We continue to believe that IIB would prioritise balance sheet stability vs. growth while the path to RoA revival remains uncertain, even if it was to get a signature hire. We believe, the bank would prioritise balance sheet liquidity/granularity; thus, it would likely report single-digit loan growth for FY26\u201327E. We estimate FY26 PPOP of ~INR 130bn, higher than annualised BAU Q4FY25 figures. We estimate ~1.6% credit costs for FY26/FY27, partly from its MFI portfolio (0\u201390dpd still elevated) and in a bid to shore-up contingent provisions (now nil). We estimate IIB to report <1% RoA and single-digit RoE for FY26/FY27 Investec on IndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs625 from Rs650 Cut earnings est by 40%/37% for FY26/27 Build in lower loan growth of 5%/10% for FY26/27 ROE outlook remains soft at 6%-7% IIB reported a PBT loss of Rs 30bn in 4Q, while also reporting a loss at the PPOP level of Rs 4.9bn. Bank highlighted negative P&L impact of Rs 49bn, relating to fraud committed by employees, much higher than Rs 26.5bn previously disclosed (for over-reported derivatives income and MFI interest) NII was down 43% YoY, which after adjusting for one-time hits was down 13% YoY (adjusted NIM at 3.5% down 45bp QoQ). This along with softer fees meant normalized PPOP (~Rs 27bn) was down 35% YoY and PPOP-level RoA is now at a soft 1.9% Slippages at Rs 50bn (5.9% vs 2.7% in 3Q) were elevated led by high MFI delinquencies (Rs 35bn of which Rs 19bn was driven by recognition of \u2018misclassified\u2019 loans). Bank\u2019s disclosures recognise fraud committed by \u2018certain employees having a significant role in accounting and financial reporting of the Bank\u2019. The P&L impact from these (recognised in 4Q) is shown in Fig 3. Bank highlighted that it is in the process of hiring a prospective CEO, for which it plans to submit names to RBI by 30 June 2025.

The demand for eco-friendly options, such as lab-grown diamonds, aligns with consumer priorities, offering a sustainable growth path. May 22, 2025 04:21 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, May  22, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Diamond Jewelry Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F\" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Diamond Jewelry Market was valued at USD 356.04 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 478.81 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 5.22%. The Diamond Jewelry market is influenced by the rising disposable incomes and changing consumer preferences, especially in emerging markets. Increased awareness and acceptance of diamond jewelry as a symbol of status, love, and luxury continue to fuel its popularity. Technological advancements, such as the rise of lab-grown diamonds, have also played a significant role by offering more affordable and sustainable alternatives. Also, evolving fashion trends, particularly in bridal and personalized jewelry, have expanded the appeal of diamond jewelry across various age groups. Retail innovation, including online platforms and customization options, has made diamond jewelry more accessible to a global audience. Also, the growing demand for eco-friendly and ethically sourced diamonds has contributed to market growth, as consumers prioritize sustainability in their purchasing decisions. Key Market Drivers Rising Disposable Incomes Rising disposable incomes are a key driver of the diamond jewelry market. As economies grow and individuals experience increased financial stability, they have more discretionary spending power, enabling them to indulge in luxury items like diamond jewelry. As a part of this, according to a recent study, as of 2024, the United States' disposable personal income rose by 0.3 percent compared to the previous month. This trend is particularly notable in emerging markets, where a growing middle class is becoming more financially secure. The desire for status symbols, such as diamonds, often correlates with higher incomes, as people are more willing to invest in premium goods that reflect their success and wealth. Hence, as consumers experience improved financial well-being, they seek to reward themselves and mark important milestones, such as engagements, anniversaries, and celebrations, with valuable jewelry. The global rise in wealth is thus expanding the market for diamond jewelry, making it more accessible to a wider range of customers across different regions. Increasing Strategy Adopted by Key Players The growing numbers of strategy adopted by major players to strengthen its foothold in the market to better serve the customers is likely to fuel its market growth in the future. As a part of this, in August 2024, Tanishq, India's biggest jewelry retail brand from the Tata group, and De Beers Group, the world's top diamond company, announced a long-term strategic partnership to increase the growing opportunity in the Indian market and introduce more Indian consumers to the rarity and value of natural diamonds. Due to a thriving economy, a growing middle class, and discriminating buyers looking for jewelry with lasting value, Indian consumers' demand for natural diamond jewelry has increased recently and now accounts for 11% of global demand. India is now the world's second-largest market for natural diamond jewelry, surpassing China in the process. Technological Advancement Technological advancements in diamond production, particularly the development of lab-grown diamonds, have significantly impacted the diamond jewelry market. Lab-grown diamonds are created using high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods, replicating the natural diamond formation process. These diamonds are virtually identical to natural ones in appearance, chemical composition, and physical properties but are more affordable due to lower production costs. This makes diamond jewelry more accessible to a broader range of consumers. Also, lab-grown diamonds offer a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to mined diamonds, which can involve harmful environmental and ethical concerns. As consumer awareness of sustainability grows, many are increasingly opting for lab-grown diamonds, which align with their environmental values. This shift is broadening the appeal of diamond jewelry, especially among younger generations who prioritize ethical and green choices. Key Market Challenges Fluctuating Prices of Diamonds The fluctuating diamond prices present a significant challenge to the diamond jewelry industry. Prices can be highly volatile due to several factors. First, the supply of natural diamonds is influenced by mining production, which can fluctuate based on discoveries, extraction costs, and regulatory changes in mining regions. Secondly, market demand plays a crucial role; economic downturns or changing consumer preferences can cause demand to dip, leading to price declines. Conversely, surges in demand can drive prices up. As a result, businesses must carefully navigate these dynamics to maintain profitability and customer trust. Ethical & Environmental Concern The mining of natural diamonds has long been associated with significant ethical and environmental concerns. Mining operations can cause deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution, and habitat destruction. Also, labor issues, such as exploitative working conditions and human rights abuses, are prevalent in some mining regions. These concerns have led to increasing demand for ethically sourced and sustainable diamonds. As a result, consumers are becoming more aware of these issues and are seeking alternatives like lab-grown diamonds, which are produced in controlled environments without the environmental damage associated with traditional mining. As ethical and environmental awareness grows, the industry is under pressure to evolve towards more responsible practices. Key Market Trends Personalization & Customization Personalization and customization in diamond jewelry have become significant trends, as consumers increasingly seek unique pieces that reflect their individuality. Advances in technology, such as 3D design tools and CAD software, allow customers to collaborate with jewelers to create bespoke designs, whether for engagement rings, anniversary gifts, or other milestones. This trend is driven by the desire for one-of-a-kind jewelry that holds personal meaning, whether through engraving, selecting specific diamonds, or incorporating gemstones with sentimental value. Customization also enables consumers to choose materials, settings, and designs that suit their tastes and lifestyle. With the rise of online platforms offering virtual consultations and design services, personalized diamond jewelry has become more accessible, allowing for a truly individualized experience and strengthening emotional connections to the pieces. Rising Popularity of Coloured Diamonds & Gemstones Colored diamonds and gemstones are becoming increasingly popular in diamond jewelry, offering a vibrant and unique alternative to traditional white diamonds. Colored diamonds, including blue, pink, green, and even black, are valued for their rarity and captivating hues. These diamonds can be used as center stones in engagement rings, earrings, and necklaces, adding an extra layer of sophistication and individuality. Also, gemstones like sapphires, emeralds, and rubies are often paired with diamonds to create eye-catching designs. These colourful accents bring depth and personality to jewelry, making pieces stand out. This trend also aligns with the growing preference for unconventional and personalized designs in the jewelry market. Rising Trend of Stackable & Layered Jewelry Stackable and layered jewelry has become a prominent trend, allowing individuals to create personalized, dynamic looks by mixing and matching diamond rings, bracelets, necklaces, and earrings. This trend emphasizes versatility and self-expression, as consumers can combine different styles, metals, and diamond shapes to curate a unique look. Stackable rings, for instance, can be worn in various combinations across fingers, while layered necklaces allow for creative pairings of different lengths and styles. Segmental Insights Distribution Channel Insights Offline dominated the global Diamond Jewelry market due to several key factors. Physical stores offer consumers the ability to examine diamonds closely, ensuring they can assess quality, cut, and color in person. As a part of this, according to a recent study, as of 2022, due to decades-high inflation, US offline retail sales hit a record high of USD 3.6 trillion. Personalized customer service is another crucial element, as knowledgeable staff can guide buyers through the selection process and provide valuable insights. Also, offline stores often offer an exclusive shopping experience, building trust and loyalty with customers. High-end retailers and luxury boutiques create a sense of prestige around diamond jewelry, making in-person shopping an essential part of the consumer decision-making process. Regional Insights North America dominated the global Diamond Jewelry market, driven by factors such as high disposable incomes, a strong cultural affinity for luxury goods, and an established retail infrastructure. The United States is one of the largest consumers of diamond jewelry, with strong demand for engagement rings, wedding bands, and high-end fashion jewelry. The region\u2019s robust jewelry industry is characterized by both well-established brands and a growing number of online retailers offering diverse collections. As a part of this, as of December 2024, The US jewelry business has been supported by the holiday season, as seen by a 4% year-over-year gain in sales. Also, consumers are increasingly prioritizing ethically sourced diamonds, contributing to the rise in demand for lab-grown diamonds. The combination of affluent consumers, a well-developed retail ecosystem, and evolving trends in sustainable jewelry continues to make North America a dominant force in the global diamond jewelry market.

A US court order, with Europol and Japan\u2019s JC3 dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware operation, seizing 2,300 domains used for command-and-control and blocking dark web markets offering the infostealer. A US court order, with Europol and Japan\u2019s JC3, dismantled Lumma Stealer\u2019s infrastructure, seizing domains and control panels. Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit sinkholed over 1,300 domains to reroute victims to safe servers for analysis and cleanup. \u201cThe Justice Department announced today the unsealing of two warrants authorizing the seizure of five internet domains used by malicious cyber actors to operate the LummaC2 information-stealing malware service.\u201d reads the press release published by DoJ. Lumma Stealer is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) infostealer designed to steal sensitive data like passwords, credit card info, and crypto wallet keys. It infiltrates systems via phishing, malvertising, and malicious downloads. It can also deploy additional malware and evade detection. The malware had infected over 394,000 Windows systems, including those of global manufacturers. Microsoft observed Lumma Stealer\u2019s rapid growth and sophistication as a MaaS used by financially motivated threat actors. Distributed via phishing, malvertising, and abuse of trusted platforms, Lumma targets browsers, wallets, and apps. Lumma\u2019s flexibility and resilience highlight the evolving cybercrime landscape and the need for layered, collaborative defense efforts. Microsoft tracks the developer of Lumma Stealer and its C2 infrastructure as threat actor Storm-2477. Ransomware groups like Octo Tempest , Storm-1607, Storm-1113, and Storm-1674 have used Lumma in their campaigns. Lumma Stealer uses a layered C2 infrastructure with hardcoded tier 1 servers and fallback C2s via Telegram and Steam, all hidden behind Cloudflare. Telegram is prioritized, and Steam is used if others fail. Affiliates can pay for personal C2s. All communication is encrypted via HTTPS. \u201cDifferent types of obfuscation are applied to each set of C2 servers. For example, the hardcoded list of C2s, and including the Telegram fallback C2 URL are protected with ChaCha20 crypto, while the Steam profile fallback C2 URL is encrypted using custom stack-based crypto algorithm that can change on each version of Lumma malware.\u201d states Microsoft . \u201cWe have identified up to six versions of Lumma Stealer, and while each of these versions focuses on improving techniques to evade antivirus detections, there are also several changes in the C2 communication protocol and formats such as the C2 domains, URI path, POST data, and others. The core Lumma malware stores the build date as part of the embedded configuration to keep track of improvements, but in our investigation, we tracked major changes using the labels \u201cversion 1\u201d through \u201cversion 6\u201d.\u201d The FBI and US CISA also\u00a0released a joint advisory\u00a0that includes tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Lumma Stealer along with indicators of compromise (IOCs). \u201cMalware like LummaC2 is deployed to steal sensitive information such as user login credentials from millions of victims in order to facilitate a host of crimes, including fraudulent bank transfers and cryptocurrency theft,\u201d said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement demonstrates that the Justice Department is resolved to use court-ordered disruptions like this one to protect the public from the theft of their personal information and their assets. The Department is also committed to working with and appreciates the efforts of the private sector to safeguard the public from cybercrime.\u201d Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi\u00a0Paganini ( SecurityAffairs \u2013\u00a0hacking,\u00a0malware) facebook linkedin twitter Cybercrime Hacking hacking news information security news IT Information Security Lumma Stealer MaaS malware Pierluigi Paganini Security Affairs Security News", "https://securityaffairs.com/178187/digital-id/new-signal-update-stops-windows-from-capturing-user-chats.html": "New Signal update stops Windows from capturing user chats Pierluigi Paganini May 22, 2025 Signal implements new screen security on Windows 11, blocking screenshots by default to protect user privacy from Microsoft\u2019s Recall feature. A Signal update for the Windows app prevents the system from capturing screenshots by default. The feature protects users\u2019 privacy from Microsoft\u2019s Recall feature . \u201cSignal Desktop now includes support for a new \u201cScreen security\u201d setting that is designed to help prevent your own computer from capturing screenshots of your Signal chats on Windows. This setting is automatically enabled by default in Signal Desktop on Windows 11.\u201d reads the announcement published by Signal. \u201cIf you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019re only implementing this on Windows right now, it\u2019s because the purpose of this setting is to protect your Signal messages from Microsoft Recall .\u201d The feature announced by Microsoft\u201d Copilot+ PCs in 2024 captures screenshots of the user\u2019s laptop every few seconds. \u201cYou can use Recall on Copilot+ PCs to find the content you have viewed on your device. Recall is currently in preview status; during this phase, we will collect customer feedback, develop more controls for enterprise customers to manage and govern Recall data, and improve the overall experience for users.\u201d reads the announcement . Microsoft explained that the Recall feature will store encrypted snapshots locally on the user\u2019s computer, the feature will be only implemented in forthcoming Copilot+ PCs. Microsoft doesn\u2019t have access to the snapshot. Privacy advocates expressed their concerns about the potential abuses of the feature. The IT giant attempted to downplay the risks for the users, it pointed out that the feature was developed with privacy and security by design and it is an \u201coptional experience.\u201d Microsoft added that Recall does not take snapshots of certain kinds of content, such as InPrivate web browsing sessions in Microsoft Edge. Users can manage which snapshots Recall collects, excluding specific apps or websites. They can also pause snapshot collection, clear some or all stored snapshots, or delete all snapshots from their device. The company suspended the rollout of the features following the public concerns, but recently started testing it again. \u201cAlthough Microsoft made several adjustments over the past twelve months in response to critical feedback, the revamped version of Recall still places any content that\u2019s displayed within privacy-preserving apps like Signal at risk.\u201d continues Signal. \u201cAs a result, we are enabling an extra layer of protection by default on Windows 11 in order to help maintain the security of Signal Desktop on that platform even though it introduces some usability trade-offs. Microsoft has simply given us no other option.\u201d Signal\u2019s new screen security blocks screenshots, showing only a blank screen. Unfortunately, it may affect some accessibility software, including screen readers or magnification tools for people who are visually impaired. Users can disable it via settings, with a warning and confirmation to avoid accidental deactivation. Signal said that when you are trying to take a screenshot with the new screen security setting enabled, you will just get a blank screen. Signal\u2019s screen security on Windows 11 is easy to disable, but the developers say it is hard to turn off accidentally, requiring a warning and confirmation. The setting only applies locally and doesn\u2019t affect screenshots or accessibility tools on other devices like macOS or Linux. \u201cWe hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future.

The APT28 group (aka Fancy Bear , Pawn Storm , Sofacy Group , Sednit ,\u00a0BlueDelta, and STRONTIUM )\u00a0has been active since at least 2007 and it has targeted\u00a0governments, militaries, and security organizations worldwide.\u00a0The group was involved also in the string of attacks that targeted 2016 Presidential election . The group operates out of military unity 26165 of the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center (GTsSS). \u201cThis joint cybersecurity advisory (CSA) highlights a Russian state-sponsored cyber campaign targeting Western logistics entities and technology companies. This includes those involved in the coordination, transport, and delivery of foreign assistance to Ukraine. Since 2022, Western logistics entities and IT companies have faced an elevated risk of targeting by the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center (85th GTsSS), military unit 26165\u2014tracked in the cybersecurity community under several names (see \u201cCybersecurity Industry Tracking\u201d).\u201d reads the joint alert . \u201cThe actors\u2019 cyber espionage-oriented campaign, targeting technology companies and logistics entities, uses a mix of previously disclosed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The authoring agencies expect similar targeting and TTP use to continue.\u201d Russian GRU Unit 26165 has targeted dozens of Western logistics and tech firms tied to Ukraine aid, including defense, maritime, air, and rail sectors across NATO nations and Ukraine. They exploited business ties to expand access, even probing ICS makers for railway systems. Targets span 13 countries, including the U.S., Germany, and France. APT28 used various methods for initial access, including brute-force attacks, spear-phishing, and exploiting known vulnerabilities in Outlook, Roundcube , WinRAR , VPNs, and SOHO devices . They also used compromised nearby devices to proxy attacks and evade detection. GRU Unit 26165 used spearphishing with fake login pages hosted on compromised devices or free services. Attackers sent emails mimicking government/cloud providers, often in the target language, and used lures like legit documents. Some campaigns bypassed MFA and used IP checks, redirectors, and delivered malware. GRU Unit 26165 exploited CVE-2023-23397 in Outlook to steal NTLM hashes via fake calendar invites and used Roundcube CVEs to access emails and run commands. Since fall 2023, they also leveraged a WinRAR flaw ( CVE-2023-38831 ) to execute code via malicious archives sent through emails or embedded links. After initial access, APT 28 conducted reconnaissance on key personnel, cybersecurity teams, and partners. The experts observed the group using tools like Impacket, PsExec, RDP, and Certipy for lateral movement and Active Directory data exfiltration. The actors harvested credentials, manipulated mailbox permissions, and accessed sensitive shipment data. Threat actors also used voice phishing to target privileged accounts. The Russia-linked group used malicious code for access, persistence, and data theft, deploying custom malware like HEADLACE and MASEPIE. They used DLL hijacking, scheduled tasks, run keys, and malicious shortcuts to maintain access. Experts warned that attackers can use other malware like OCEANMAP and STEELHOOK in cyber operations against logistics and IT sectors. The threat actors exfiltrated data using PowerShell, APIs (EWS/IMAP), and periodic queries, leveraging local infrastructure to evade detection. Attackers also targeted IP cameras near Ukrainian borders and military sites via RTSP, using default/brute-forced credentials to access live feeds. This campaign helped monitor aid and material movement into Ukraine. The alert includes general and detailed security mitigations.

Driven by government mandate and international climate goals, the demand for capital in these sectors is set to rise sharply. These investments are critical not only for meeting sustainability goals, but also for strengthening long-term energy and food security in India. Clean Mobility: Electrification of public and intercity transport- A capital investment opportunity of $200bn by 2030. Under the latest government mandate, all new buses procured under state and municipal schemes must be electric. With over 1.7 lakh buses set for replacement and an average cost of \u20b91 crore each, this translates into a \u20b91.7 lakh crore market opportunity in the public sector alone. A similar scale of opportunity exists in the private intercity bus segment, connecting metros like Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. Top OEMs including Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, and JBM Auto are expected to lead this shift. These players are also entering operations and maintenance, opening avenues for senior debt, equity capital, and structured financing. Green Energy transition: Industrial solar & battery storage: A capital investment opportunity of $200BN by 2030. Driven by global decarbonization targets\u2014especially in industries like steel and aluminium\u2014India Inc. is rapidly adopting dedicated solar plants and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). With export-dependent sectors preparing for EU\u2019s green steel mandates post-2030, clean energy integration is accelerating. To balance peak demand and grid stability, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are gaining momentum. Gujarat has already issued multi-thousand crore tenders, marking the beginning of a nationwide rollout. Circular Economy: Waste to value- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030. India\u2019s new extended producer responsibility (EPR) mandates are transforming the recycling industry. In the battery segment alone, 100% recovery compliance has made organized recycling not just viable but necessary. Lead-acid battery recycling is achieving over 97% efficiency, and similar circular systems are emerging for Plastics, lithium-ion batteries, tires, and e-waste under EPR scheme ( Extended Producers Responsibility). This shift is curbing hazardous informal processing and unlocking new revenue streams in regulated recycling ecosystems. Agriculture & Food Security: Modern silo infrastructure; Data centers & Green Tech Ecosystems- A capital investment opportunity of $100bn by 2030 The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is entering long-term \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d contracts with private players for high-tech grain silos, akin to the tank farms in oil and gas. These silos, strategically located across major agricultural belts, will store grains like rice, wheat, and pulses in scientifically designed, climate-resilient facilities, ensuring year-round food availability and minimizing wastage. India\u2019s growing digital economy is fuelling demand for green-powered data centers, which now serve as hubs integrating solar, wind, energy storage, and smart grid technologies. This emerging sector represents the convergence of digital and sustainable infrastructure, offering scalable and future-ready investment opportunities. 12:28 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live news: Himadri Speciality Chemical approves acquisition of 16.24% stake in International Battery Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on fully diluted basis.

This was made worse by Moody\u2019s recent reduction of the US credit rating because of growing debt levels and the Fed\u2019s cautious economic outlook. \u00b7 With the continuous turmoil in West Asia and President Trump\u2019s apparent retreat from mediating the Russia-Ukraine issue, geopolitical tensions further increased the allure of gold. \u00b7 In the meantime, Chinese customs statistics revealed that robust demand and the central bank\u2019s issuance of additional import quotas amid the height of US-China trade tensions caused gold imports to soar to an 11-month high of 127.5 metric tonnes in April, up 73% from March. Technical Triggers \u00b7 As gold has changed its momentum and moved higher above $3300 (~Rs 95500), the rally can continue towards $3380 (~Rs 97500), but prices are expected not to sustain beyond that. \u00b7 Silver prices are gaining momentum and close to their resistance level of $34(~Rs 99500). We could see a reversal if prices don\u2019t sustain. If prices sustain above these levels, the next target would be $35(~Rs 102,000). 11:54 | May 22, 2025 Stock market live updates today: Highways Infrastructure Trust adds 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model highway projects from PNC Infratech Highways Infrastructure Trust (HIT), a SEBI-registered infrastructure investment trust, announces the addition of 10 operational Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) highway projects from PNC Infratech Ltd to its portfolio.

We cut FY26-27 est. by 40% as we adjust for the inflated base profitability Rating downgrade due to path to 1% ROA now long drawn and business uncertainty The next event to monitor is the recommendation of new CEO by the Board to the RBI by 30th June ICICI Sec on IndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs650 Reports loss with weak core NIM/PPOP; growth/RoA revival yet uncertain Core profitability, adjusted for one-offs, was weak too with NIM at 3.47% (down 46bps QoQ) while PPOP slipped 24% YoY to INR 30.62bn. CET 1 and LCR levels are comfortable at 15.1% and 118%, respectively. The board is yet to recommend a name for its MD&CEO position to the RBI. We continue to believe that IIB would prioritise balance sheet stability vs. growth while the path to RoA revival remains uncertain, even if it was to get a signature hire. We believe, the bank would prioritise balance sheet liquidity/granularity; thus, it would likely report single-digit loan growth for FY26\u201327E. We estimate FY26 PPOP of ~INR 130bn, higher than annualised BAU Q4FY25 figures. We estimate ~1.6% credit costs for FY26/FY27, partly from its MFI portfolio (0\u201390dpd still elevated) and in a bid to shore-up contingent provisions (now nil). We estimate IIB to report <1% RoA and single-digit RoE for FY26/FY27 Investec on ndusInd Bank SELL; TP Rs625 from Rs650 Cut earnings est by 40%/37% for FY26/27 Build in lower loan growth of 5%/10% for FY26/27 ROE outlook remains soft at 6%-7% IIB reported a PBT loss of Rs 30bn in 4Q, while also reporting a loss at the PPOP level of Rs 4.9bn. Bank highlighted negative P&L impact of Rs 49bn, relating to fraud committed by employees, much higher than Rs 26.5bn previously disclosed (for over-reported derivatives income and MFI interest) NII was down 43% YoY, which after adjusting for one-time hits was down 13% YoY (adjusted NIM at 3.5% down 45bp QoQ). This along with softer fees meant normalized PPOP (~Rs 27bn) was down 35% YoY and PPOP-level RoA is now at a soft 1.9% Slippages at Rs 50bn (5.9% vs 2.7% in 3Q) were elevated led by high MFI delinquencies (Rs 35bn of which Rs 19bn was driven by recognition of \u2018misclassified\u2019 loans). Bank\u2019s disclosures recognise fraud committed by \u2018certain employees having a significant role in accounting and financial reporting of the Bank\u2019. The P&L impact from these (recognised in 4Q) is shown in Fig 3. Bank highlighted that it is in the process of hiring a prospective CEO, for which it plans to submit names to RBI by 30 June 2025. We factor in softer PPOP UBS on IndusInd Sell, TP Rs 600 Q4 : Weak amidst uncertainty MFI loans had largest contribution to total -ve one-offs Board to recommend possible CEO names to RBI before 30th June Stk not inexpensive at current levels & uncertainty likely to result in derating MS on Indusind Downgrade to Underweight with Equal-weight; Cut TP to Rs 700 from Rs 755 Bear Case Playing Out Expected sharp NII miss post recent disclosures but were negatively surprised by incorrectly classified MFI slippages High margin loan mix is moving lower and will weigh on RoA recovery Expect gradual earnings recovery on a weak starting point Valuation at 0.9x FY26 book is not cheap in the context of 7-10% RoE that we expect over next two years Macquarie on Indusind Maintain Outperform with TP of Rs 1210 Q4: Large earnings miss, multiple events recognized Asset quality still a concern If one assumes that cleanup is largely done, which in itself is questionable, normalised PPOP was Rs 12000 cr annualised for Q4 Stock currently at 5x trailing PPOP, which is lower than peers Further, on a trailing book, the stock trades at 0.9x FY25 P/B Clarity around management succession, peak credit costs, sustainable NIMs, and governance are key monitorables CLSA on Indusind Maintain Hold; Cut TP to Rs 725 from Rs 780 A quarter to forget Core profitability muted; several one-offs lead to Rs22bn loss Core slippages in MFI elevated, but other segments stable FY26 to be a year of uncertainty Jefferies on Indusind Maintain Buy; Cut TP to Rs 920 from Rs 1040 Clean-up was larger than anticipated Exit run-rate of business is low; the new CEO is to lay a path forward Valuations are reasonable HSBC on Indusind Downgrade to Reduce from Buy; Hike TP to Rs 660 from Rs 770 IndusInd has effectively been pushed back to the pre-2009 era Right now, there is no clarity on the rebuilding process Cut FY26-27 EPS estimates by 41-43% as management has made one-off adjustments to correct accounting discrepancies MS on Interglobe Aviation OW, TP Raised to Rs 6502 4QF25 EBITDA of Rs59.5bn was 13% ahead of estimate.
